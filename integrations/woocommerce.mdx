### **Overview**

The WooCommerce integration connects your WordPress store with Yuko, allowing you to import orders, sync customers, and collect verified reviews automatically.

### **Setup Steps**

1. Log in to your **Yuko Dashboard**.
2. Go to **Settings → Integrations → WooCommerce**.
3. Click **Connect WooCommerce Store**.
4. Enter your **store URL** (e.g., https://yourstore.com).
5. Authorize Yuko to access your WooCommerce data.
6. Wait for the sync to complete — this typically takes a few minutes.

Once connected, Yuko automatically imports:

- Order data
- Product listings
- Customer details

### **What You Can Do**

- Send automated review requests when orders are fulfilled.
- Display “Verified Buyer” badges based on WooCommerce order history.
- Import all past WooCommerce reviews into Yuko.

Track review performance per order.
