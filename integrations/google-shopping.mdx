### Feed generation status

After enabling the setting, you’ll see a message indicating that the feed is being generated.

- The feed typically takes **3–5 minutes** to generate.
- Once ready, the **feed URL** will appear in the same section.
- Use this URL to connect your store with **Google Merchant Center**.

**Notes**

- Google requires at least 50 reviews per store to show ratings.
- Ratings appear once Google approves your review feed.

Yuko automatically formats the data according to Google’s specifications.
