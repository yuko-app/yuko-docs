- Paste the **Webhook URL** copied from the add‑on.
- Under **Webhook Events**, choose which events should trigger the webhook.
- You can select one or multiple of the following:

    **Review Submitted** – triggers when a customer submits a review.

  **Review Published**   – triggers when a review is approved/published.

  **Review Deleted**   – triggers when a review is removed.

  <Tip>
    For loyalty points, it’s usually best to select **Review Published**, so customers only earn points for approved reviews.

**3. Add the Secret Key**

- Yuko generates a **Signature Key** after the webhook is created.
- Copy this key.
