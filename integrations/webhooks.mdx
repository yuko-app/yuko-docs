## **Overview**

Webhooks allow Yuko to send real-time data to any external system the moment an event occurs.\
They are perfect for advanced setups — such as custom dashboards, CRMs, ERPs, Slack notifications, or any tool that can receive JSON data.

When an event is triggered in Yuko, your webhook endpoint instantly receives the payload, allowing you to automate workflows beyond the Yuko ecosystem.
