Workflows save you time by automating repetitive review and reward tasks.\
Once set up, Yuko automatically triggers emails and actions based on your store’s events — such as order completion, review submission, or photo upload.

You can:

- Request product reviews automatically after purchase
- Send reminders to customers who haven’t reviewed yet
- Reward reviewers with discounts
- Trigger follow-up emails when reviews are posted
