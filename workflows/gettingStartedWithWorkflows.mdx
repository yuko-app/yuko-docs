### **Navigation**

Yuko Dashboard → **Workflows → Create New Workflow**

### **How Workflows Work**

Each workflow follows a **trigger → condition → action** structure:

1. **Trigger:** What event starts the workflow (e.g., “Order Fulfilled”).
2. **Condition:** Who or what qualifies for the workflow (e.g., “Customer has not reviewed”).
3. **Action:** What happens (e.g., “Send review request email”).

You can create multiple workflows for different use cases.

### **Default Workflows**

Yuko provides three ready-to-use workflows out of the box:

- **Review Request Workflow**
- **Review Reminder Workflow**
- **Review Submitted & Reward Workflow**

You can customize or duplicate them anytime.
