title: "4.3 Sidebar Widget"
---

The Sidebar Widget is a small floating tab that opens a panel of customer reviews.\
It appears on the side of your website, so it never blocks your main content.\
This is a great way to show social proof on homepages, landing pages, blogs, or any page where no product widget exists.

### **Navigation**

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Widgets → Reviews Sidebar**

**How the Sidebar Widget works**

The Sidebar Widget shows reviews based on the content source you choose:

- **Current product’s reviews** – if the customer is on a product page
- **Related reviews** – reviews from similar or linked products
- **All reviews** – a global feed of all approved reviews

This makes it easy to show social proof everywhere on your store.

The widget can smoothly slide in and out, and it automatically adjusts to fit different screen sizes.
