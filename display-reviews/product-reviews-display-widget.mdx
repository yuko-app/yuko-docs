---

The Product Reviews Display Widget is the main review section on your product pages.\
It shows customer feedback, star ratings, photos, videos, and all review details in one clean place. Most stores place this widget below the product description so shoppers can read reviews before they buy.

You can customize the layout, style, colors, and what information you want to show — all with live preview inside Yuko.

## **1. Customize the Product Reviews Display Widget:**

### **Choose a layout**

Yuko offers multiple layout options so you can display reviews in the style that fits your brand.

### **Grid**

A neat, card-style layout.\
Best for stores with many photo or video reviews.

### **List**

A simple vertical feed.\
Great for text-heavy reviews or long-form feedback.

### **Mosaic**

A staggered, dynamic layout.\
Perfect for stores with lots of media-based reviews.

### **Minimal**

A clean, compact look.\
Shows only the review text and rating — ideal for lightweight pages.

## **2. Style settings**

You can change the entire look of the widget using built-in style controls.

### **Card appearance**

- **Shadow:** None / Light / Dark
- **Corners:** Sharp / Slightly Rounded / Rounded / Extra Rounded

### **Colors**

Adjust:

- Star colors
- Text colors
- Background colors\
  These can follow your brand palette or your theme.

### **Fonts**

## **3. Review details**

Choose what information you want to show in each review card.

You can turn ON/OFF:

- Review date
- Product variant
- Reviewer name
- Media (photos/videos)
- Review title
- Pagination (Load more button)

---

## **4. Visibility settings**

Control when and where reviews appear.

Options include:

- **Always show**
- **Always hide**
- **Hide if no reviews** (good for new products)

---

## **5. Cross-product reviews**

If you sell similar or variant products, you can choose to:

- Show reviews from related items
- Combine reviews from multiple product versions\
  This increases social proof for products with fewer direct reviews.

---

## **6. Sorting options**

Sort reviews by:

- Newest first
- Oldest first
- Highest rating
- Lowest rating

You can set the default sorting for all products.

## **7. Advanced CSS (optional)**

For finer design — padding, spacing, hover effects, typography tweaks — you can add custom CSS.

This section is great for store owners who want complete control or pixel-perfect branding.
