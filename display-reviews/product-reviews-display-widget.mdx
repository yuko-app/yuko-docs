title: "4.2 Product Reviews Display Widget"
---

The Product Reviews Display Widget is the main review section on your product pages.\
It shows customer feedback, star ratings, photos, videos, and all review details in one clean place. Most stores place this widget below the product description so shoppers can read reviews before they buy.

You can customize the layout, style, colors, and what information you want to show — all with live preview inside Yuko.
