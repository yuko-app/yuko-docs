---

The Product Reviews Display Widget is the main review section on your product pages.\
It shows customer feedback, star ratings, photos, videos, and all review details in one clean place. Most stores place this widget below the product description so shoppers can read reviews before they buy.

You can customize the layout, style, colors, and what information you want to show — all with live preview inside Yuko.

## **Customize the Product Reviews Display Widget:**

## **1. Layout**

Choose how the review section looks and how information is arranged.\
These settings control the structure of both the review cards and the rating header.

### **Review Section Layout**

You can pick from different layout options to match your design style:

- **Grid** – A clean card-based layout, great for stores with many photo reviews.
- **List** – A simple vertical feed, best for long text reviews.
- **Mosaic** – A dynamic, staggered layout that highlights visual reviews.

### **Rating Section Layout**

Controls how your rating summary (average rating, bars, totals) appears:

- **Horizontal** – A traditional layout with rating bars stacked vertically.
- **Compact** – A smaller, space-saving version for clean product pages.
