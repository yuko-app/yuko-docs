The Carousel Widget displays your best customer reviews in a rotating slider. It’s perfect for homepages, landing pages, and sales funnels where you want to add strong social proof without taking too much space.\
A well-placed carousel helps increase trust, highlight top feedback, and improve conversions.\

**How it looks**

You can add the Carousel Widget to:

- The homepage
- Landing/offer pages
- Testimonial sections
- Product or collection pages

The widget rotates reviews automatically or through arrows and dots, depending on your settings.

## **How the Carousel Widget works**

The widget pulls approved reviews and displays them as sliding testimonial cards.\
You control:

- How many reviews appear at once
- How fast the slider moves
- Whether users can navigate using arrows or dots
- Which reviews are shown (top-rated, most recent, with photos, etc.)
- The design, layout, and colors

This ensures the carousel always looks clean, smooth, and optimized for engagement.
