title: "4.4 Star Rating Widget"
---

The Star Rating Widget displays your product’s average rating and total review count. It usually appears under the product title or price, and on collection pages. This small visual cue helps customers quickly understand product quality, increasing click-through rates and overall trust.

### **Navigation**

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Widgets → Star Rating**

**How the Star Rating Widget Works**

The widget calculates the product’s average rating based on approved reviews and displays stars and review counts according to your chosen settings.

You can choose to display:

- Stars only
- Review count only
- Stars + review count

You can also enable **empty stars** so that every product’s badge stays the same width, even for products with fewer reviews.

**Dynamic Text Placeholders**\
You can customize the text next to the stars using placeholders:

| Placeholder  | Description                             |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `{{count}}`  | Total number of reviews                 |
| `{{rating}}` | Average rating (rounded to one decimal) |

Example formats:

- “Rated rating based on count reviews”
- “count customers rated this rating stars”
