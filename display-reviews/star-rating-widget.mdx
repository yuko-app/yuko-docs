title: "4.4 Star Rating Widget"
---

The Star Rating Widget displays your product’s average rating and total review count. It usually appears under the product title or price, and on collection pages. This small visual cue helps customers quickly understand product quality, increasing click-through rates and overall trust.

### **Navigation**

**How the Star Rating Widget works**

Yuko calculates the product’s average rating based on approved reviews and displays the star icons and count following your chosen settings.

You can choose to show:

- Stars only
- Review count only
- Stars + review count (recommended)

You can also enable empty stars so each product’s badge stays the same width — even if it has fewer reviews.

Placeholders help you customize text:

- **{{count}}** → number of reviews
- **{{rating}}** → average rating (rounded to one decimal)
