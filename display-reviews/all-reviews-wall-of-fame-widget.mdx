### **Navigation**

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Widgets → All Reviews**

The Wall of Fame Widget displays every approved review from your store — across all products — in one clean, organized layout.\
It’s ideal for testimonial pages, community pages, landing pages, or any page where you want to show social proof at scale.

This widget helps customers explore real experiences from your entire store, not just one product, which can greatly improve trust and conversions.

### **How it looks**

**Grid layout:**\
A balanced grid of reviews, great for testimonials and landing pages.

**List layout:**\
A longer, vertical list of reviews for detailed reading.

**Masonry layout:**\
A dynamic, Pinterest-style layout for reviews with mixed text lengths and media.

### **How the Wall of Fame Widget works**

Yuko collects all **approved** reviews from your store — product reviews, shop reviews, or both — and displays them based on your selected layout.

You can control:

- Which types of reviews appear
- Whether reviews with photos/videos appear first
- How reviews load (all at once or infinite scroll)
- Headings and labels
- Colors, spacing, and typography

This gives you full flexibility to design a review wall that fits your brand and page style.
