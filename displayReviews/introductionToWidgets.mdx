Yuko widgets make it easy to display and collect reviews directly on your site.

Each widget can be placed on product pages, sidebars, or landing pages using shortcodes or embed snippets.\
You can use multiple widgets together for a cohesive experience — for example, show product reviews on PDPs and a testimonial carousel on your homepage.\
