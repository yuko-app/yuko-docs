Yuko’s **Questions & Answers (Q&A)** feature lets customers ask questions directly on your product pages — and allows you (or other buyers) to reply publicly.

This builds transparency, reduces support tickets, and encourages more informed purchases.

### **Navigation**

Yuko Dashboard → **Manage** **Q & A**

With Yuko Q&A, you can:

- Collect customer questions directly from product pages.
- Display answers publicly for other visitors.
- Reply as the store admin or allow peer responses.
- Moderate content before it goes live.
