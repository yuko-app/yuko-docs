### **Navigation**

Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → General**

Yuko can automatically publish new reviews without manual approval.

**Options:**

- **Enabled:** Reviews are instantly published once submitted.
- **Disabled:** Reviews remain in “Pending” until approved.

**Tip:**\
 Enable auto-publish if you already use a spam filter and trust your customer base. Keep it off if you prefer hands-on moderation.
