## Build Trust with Overall Shopping Experience Reviews

Shop reviews (also called Site Reviews or Store Reviews) let customers rate their entire shopping experience — not just individual products. These testimonials showcase your customer service, shipping speed, checkout experience, and overall brand quality.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Collect testimonials about overall shopping experience
- Showcase service quality and reliability
- Build trust with first-time visitors
- Highlight shipping, support, and brand values
- Display store-wide social proof on homepage

<Info>
  **Impact:** Stores with shop reviews see 15-25% higher trust scores and convert 12% more first-time visitors

    - Best asked 7-10 days after delivery

    **Goal:** Help shoppers decide on specific products
  </Card>
  <Card title="Store Reviews" icon="store">
    **About overall store experience**

    - Rating for entire shopping journey
    - Focus on service, shipping, checkout
    - "Great customer service and fast shipping"
    - Appear on homepage/testimonial sections

<Warning>
  **Important:** Don't ask for shop reviews in first purchase emails. Wait until customers have 2-3 orders or a great service interaction. Shop reviews work best from loyal customers who know your brand.

  **Pro tip:** Don't try to collect shop reviews from everyone. Focus on customers who have ordered 2-3 times or had exceptional service interactions. These customers know your brand well enough to give meaningful testimonials.
