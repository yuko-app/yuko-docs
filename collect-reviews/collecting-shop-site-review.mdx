## Build Trust with Overall Shopping Experience Reviews

Shop reviews (also called Site Reviews or Store Reviews) let customers rate their entire shopping experience — not just individual products. These testimonials showcase your customer service, shipping speed, checkout experience, and overall brand quality.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Collect testimonials about overall shopping experience
- Showcase service quality and reliability
- Build trust with first-time visitors
- Highlight shipping, support, and brand values
- Display store-wide social proof on homepage

<Info>
  **Impact:** Stores with shop reviews see 15-25% higher trust scores and convert 12% more first-time visitors

## Shop Reviews vs Product Reviews

Understanding the difference helps you collect the right feedback at the right time:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Product Reviews" icon="box">
    **About specific items purchased**

    - Rating for individual products
    - Focus on product quality, fit, features
    - "This shirt fits perfectly"
    - Appear on product pages
    - Best asked 7-10 days after delivery

    **Goal:** Help shoppers decide on specific products
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shop Reviews" icon="store">
    **About overall store experience**

    - Rating for entire shopping journey
    - Focus on service, shipping, checkout
    - "Great customer service and fast shipping"
    - Appear on homepage/testimonial sections
    - Best asked after multiple purchases

    **Goal:** Build overall brand trust and credibility
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Important:** Don't ask for shop reviews in first purchase emails. Wait until customers have 2-3 orders or a great service interaction. Shop reviews work best from loyal customers who know your brand.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Shop Reviews" icon="toggle-on">
    Navigate to the Review Collection Form settings and enable **Shop Reviews** as a collection option.

    **What this does:**

    - Adds "Leave Store Review" option to your site
    - Creates dedicated shop review submission form
    - Allows customers to review overall experience
    - Separate from product review forms
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Shop Review Form" icon="sliders">
    Configure the form fields and questions for shop reviews.

    **Recommended fields:**

    - Overall star rating (required)
    - Review text: "Tell us about your experience" (optional)
    - Reviewer name (required)

    - Would you recommend us? (Yes/No toggle)

    **Optional fields:**

    - Upload photo (optional)

      **Keep it simple:** Shop review forms should be even shorter than product reviews. 3-4 fields maximum. Focus on overall rating and open-ended experience question.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Shop Review Links to Your Site" icon="link">
    Place "Leave a Review" links in strategic locations.

    **Best placements:**

    - Footer: "Rate Your Experience"
    - Thank you page after checkout
    - Order confirmation emails (for repeat customers)
    - Customer account dashboard
    - About Us page

    **Link format:**

    ```
    https://your-store.com/shop-reviews
    ```

    Yuko provides embeddable widgets and direct links.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Display Shop Reviews" icon="browser">
    Choose where to showcase your shop reviews.

    **Recommended locations:**

    - Homepage hero section (testimonial carousel)
    - About Us page (trust section)
    - Footer (trust badges)
    - Landing pages (social proof)
    - Checkout page (reassurance)

    → [Learn about display widgets](/display-reviews/introduction-to-widgets)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Encourage Shop Reviews from Loyal Customers" icon="heart">
    Strategically ask for shop reviews from your best customers.

    **When to ask:**

    - After 2-3 successful orders
    - After great customer service interaction
    - When customer contacts support with praise
    - 30 days after first purchase (for subscribers)
    - When loyalty program member reaches milestone

    <Warning>
      **Never auto-request shop reviews** to all customers like you do with product reviews. Shop reviews should be selectively requested from customers who have had enough experience with your brand.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rating Section" iconType="regular">
    Controls how customers rate your product and how the rating prompt appears.

    ### **General Settings**

    | Field                              | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
    | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Text**                           | The main prompt asking the customer to rate the product. Supports dynamic tags like `{product_name}`. <br />**Example:** _“How Would You Rate {product_name}?”_    |
    | **Description**                    | Optional subtext providing context or encouragement. <br />**Example:** _“Your feedback helps us make every fit even better. Tap a star to rate your experience.”_ |
    | **Lowest Rating Text (Optional)**  | Label displayed under the 1-star rating. <br />Ideal for guiding expectations (“Dislike it”).                                                                      |
    | **Highest Rating Text (Optional)** | Label displayed under the 5-star rating. <br />Helps frame positive feedback (“Love it!”).                                                                         |

    ### **Best Practices**

    - Keep the main question short and direct.
    - Use positive and helpful tone in the description to encourage participation.
    - Lowest/Highest rating labels help customers understand the meaning of each end of the scale.

    <Tip>
      **Best practice:** Keep shop review forms to 3-4 fields total. The easier it is, the more testimonials you'll collect.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Photos Section" icon="message">
    Allow customers to upload images that enhance the authenticity of their reviews.

    ### **General Settings**

    <Check>
      **Pro tip:** If offering a thank-you discount, send it via email (not on-screen). This ensures you capture their email for future marketing.

    - Keep the title inviting and friendly.

    | **Review Disclaimer Text (optional)** | Shows a note about terms, privacy, and public posting. <br />**Example:** _“By submitting, I acknowledge the Terms of Service…”_ |

    ### **Why This Matters**

    Accurate reviewer information increases trust and enables “verified buyer” checks. The disclaimer ensures transparency.

      **Maximize impact:** Display shop reviews in 2-3 locations. Homepage gets attention, footer provides consistent trust signal, dedicated page gives detailed social proof.

## Shop Review Collection Strategy

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Starting Out (0-50 Reviews)">
    **Best for:** New stores, just launching shop reviews

    **Focus:** Get your first 20-30 shop reviews from best customers

    **Strategy:**

    1. ❌ Don't auto-request shop reviews from all customers yet
    2. ✅ Manually email 20-30 happy customers asking for testimonials
    3. ✅ Add "Leave a Review" link in footer
    4. ✅ Ask customers who contact support with praise
    5. ✅ Offer small thank-you (5-10% off) for shop reviews

    **Expected results in 30 days:**

    - 15-25 shop reviews
    - 3-5% response rate when personally asked
    - Higher quality, detailed testimonials

    **Why this works:**

    - Personal requests get better responses
    - You control who you ask (select happy customers)
    - Early shop reviews set quality standard
    - Small incentive shows appreciation

    <Tip>
      **Template email:** "Hi [Name], we noticed you've ordered from us 3 times now! Would you mind sharing your experience with other shoppers? It only takes 60 seconds: [link]. As a thank you, here's 10% off your next order."
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Growing (50-200 Reviews)">
    **Best for:** Established stores, want more shop reviews

    **Focus:** Systematic collection from loyal customers

    **Strategy:**

    1. ✅ Auto-request shop reviews from customers with 2+ orders
    2. ✅ Add shop review form to "My Account" dashboard
    3. ✅ Show "Leave a Review" prompt on order confirmation page
    4. ✅ Ask for shop reviews 30 days after first purchase
    5. ✅ Display shop reviews prominently on homepage

    **Expected results in 30 days:**

    - 30-60 new shop reviews
    - 2-4% conversion rate from requests
    - Mix of product + service feedback

    **Why this works:**

    - Targeting repeat customers (they know your brand)
    - Multiple touchpoints increase participation
    - Homepage display encourages others to review
    - Automated system scales with order volume

    <Warning>
      **Don't spam:** Only send shop review requests to customers who haven't recently received product review requests. Space them out (minimum 14 days apart).
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Maximizing (200+ Reviews)">
    **Best for:** Large stores, systematic testimonial collection

    **Focus:** Optimize collection and showcase best reviews

    **Strategy:**

    1. ✅ Segment shop review requests by customer tier (VIP, repeat, new)
    2. ✅ A/B test timing (30 days vs 60 days after first order)
    3. ✅ Feature best shop reviews in marketing (emails, ads, social)
    4. ✅ Create video testimonials from top text reviews
    5. ✅ Use shop reviews as homepage hero content
    6. ✅ Add shop review highlights to product pages

    **Expected results in 30 days:**

    - 80-150+ new shop reviews
    - 4-6% conversion rate (optimized)
    - Rich testimonials used across marketing

    **Why this works:**

    - Segmentation personalizes requests (higher response)
    - Testing finds optimal timing
    - Featured reviews encourage more submissions
    - Shop reviews become marketing asset
    - Multi-purpose use maximizes ROI

    <Check>
      **Pro move:** Turn your best shop reviews into case studies. Reach out to customers who left detailed positive reviews and ask if they'd be willing to do a short interview or video testimonial. Offer \$50-100 gift card as compensation.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When should I ask for shop reviews vs product reviews?" icon="question">
    **Different timing for different feedback types**

    **Product reviews - Ask soon after delivery:**

    - 7-10 days after product delivered
    - Customer has used the product enough to review
    - Focus on product quality, fit, features
    - Send to all customers (automated)

    **Shop reviews - Ask after customer knows your brand:**

    - After 2-3 successful orders (repeat customer)
    - 30-60 days after first purchase (enough experience)
    - After great customer service interaction
    - When customer becomes loyalty member
    - Selectively to happy customers (not automated for everyone)

    **Can I ask for both?** Yes, but space them out:

    - Order 1: Send product review request (7 days after delivery)
    - Order 2: Send product review request (7 days after delivery)
    - Order 3: Send shop review request (focus on overall experience)

    Or:

    - Send product review request 7 days after delivery
    - Send shop review request 30 days after first order

    <Warning>
      **Don't overwhelm:** Never send product review request and shop review request in the same week. Space them at least 14 days apart to avoid review fatigue.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should shop reviews be separate from product reviews?" icon="split">
    **It depends on your display strategy**

    **Option 1: Keep them completely separate** (recommended)

    - Shop reviews appear only in testimonial sections
    - Product reviews appear only on product pages
    - Clear distinction for customers
    - Easier to manage and display
    - Less confusing

    **Where shop reviews go:**

    - Homepage testimonial carousel
    - About Us page
    - Dedicated shop reviews page
    - Footer trust section
    - Checkout reassurance

    **Where product reviews go:**

    - Individual product pages
    - Product listing grids
    - Review widgets throughout site

    **Option 2: Combine them in some locations**

    - Show both on homepage (mixed testimonials)
    - Filter option: "Shop Reviews" vs "Product Reviews"
    - All reviews on dedicated reviews page
    - More content, but requires clear labeling

    **Recommended approach:** Keep them separate for clarity. Shop reviews are testimonials about your brand, product reviews are buying guides for specific items. Different purposes, different placements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I get customers to leave detailed shop reviews?" icon="pen">
    **Most shop reviews are too brief - here's how to get detailed testimonials:**

    **1. Ask specific questions in the form:** Instead of: "How was your experience?" Ask: "What did you love most about shopping with us?"

    Other good questions:

    - "How did our product/service help you?"
    - "What made you choose us over other stores?"
    - "How was your shipping and customer service experience?"
    - "What would you tell a friend about us?"

    **2. Show examples of good reviews:** Display 2-3 detailed review examples above the form:

    - "Check out what Sarah shared about her experience"
    - Shows customers what "good" looks like
    - Increases average review length by 40%

    **3. Offer incentive for detailed reviews:** "Leave a detailed review (50+ words) and get 15% off your next order"

    - Longer reviews only (system can count words)
    - Better quality feedback
    - 2-3x more detailed testimonials

    **4. Follow up with top customers personally:** Email: "Hi [Name], we'd love to feature your story. Would you be willing to share more about your experience with us? We can send you a few questions, and as a thank you, here's a \$25 gift card."

    - Personal outreach gets best testimonials
    - Can turn into case study or video
    - Shows you value their feedback

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** The best shop reviews come from conversations, not forms. When a customer emails you with praise, reply: "Thank you! Would you mind sharing this on our reviews page? [link]. Your words would really help other shoppers discover us."

  <Accordion title="How many shop reviews do I need to build trust?" icon="chart-line">
    **Minimum thresholds for credibility:**

    **10-20 shop reviews: Basic trust**

    - Better than nothing
    - Shows some customer validation
    - Not enough to be convincing
    - Keep collecting

    **50-100 shop reviews: Good trust level**

    - Enough for credibility
    - Shoppers feel reassured
    - Can showcase on homepage
    - Baseline for most stores

    **200-500 shop reviews: Strong trust**

    - Significant social proof
    - Comparable to competitors
    - Can feature in marketing

    - Major credibility signal
    - Industry leader status

    - Use as marketing asset

    **Quality matters more than quantity:**

    **Better to have:**

    - 30 detailed, 5-star shop reviews with photos
    - Than 200 brief "Great!" reviews

    **What makes shop reviews more credible:**

    - ✅ Detailed testimonials (50+ words)
    - ✅ Recent reviews (within last 6 months)
    - ✅ Mix of ratings (not all 5-stars)
    - ✅ Verified customer badges
    - ✅ Photo/video testimonials
    - ✅ Responses from store owner
    - ✅ Specific details mentioned

    <Info>
      **Reality check:** Don't wait until you have 100+ shop reviews to start displaying them. Show shop reviews as soon as you have 5-10. Seeing even a few testimonials is better than seeing none.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Don't try to collect shop reviews from everyone. Focus on customers who have ordered 2-3 times or had exceptional service interactions. These customers know your brand well enough to give meaningful testimonials.
