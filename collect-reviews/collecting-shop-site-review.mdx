## Build Trust with Overall Shopping Experience Reviews

Shop reviews (also called Site Reviews or Store Reviews) let customers rate their entire shopping experience — not just individual products. These testimonials showcase your customer service, shipping speed, checkout experience, and overall brand quality.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Collect testimonials about overall shopping experience
- Showcase service quality and reliability
- Build trust with first-time visitors
- Highlight shipping, support, and brand values
- Display store-wide social proof on homepage

<Info>
  **Impact:** Stores with shop reviews see 15-25% higher trust scores and convert 12% more first-time visitors

## Store Reviews vs Product Reviews

Understanding the difference helps you collect the right feedback at the right time:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Product Reviews" icon="box">
    **About specific items purchased**

    - Rating for individual products
    - Focus on product quality, fit, features
    - "This shirt fits perfectly"
    - Appear on product pages
    - Best asked 7-10 days after delivery

    **Goal:** Help shoppers decide on specific products
  </Card>
  <Card title="Store Reviews" icon="store">
    **About overall store experience**

    - Rating for entire shopping journey
    - Focus on service, shipping, checkout
    - "Great customer service and fast shipping"
    - Appear on homepage/testimonial sections
    - Best asked after multiple purchases

    **Goal:** Build overall brand trust and credibility
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Important:** Don't ask for shop reviews in first purchase emails. Wait until customers have 2-3 orders or a great service interaction. Shop reviews work best from loyal customers who know your brand.

## Shop Review Collection Strategy

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Starting Out (0-50 Reviews)">
    **Best for:** New stores, just launching shop reviews

    **Focus:** Get your first 20-30 shop reviews from best customers

    **Strategy:**

    1. ❌ Don't auto-request shop reviews from all customers yet
    2. ✅ Manually email 20-30 happy customers asking for testimonials
    3. ✅ Add "Leave a Review" link in footer
    4. ✅ Ask customers who contact support with praise
    5. ✅ Offer small thank-you (5-10% off) for shop reviews

    **Expected results in 30 days:**

    - 15-25 shop reviews
    - 3-5% response rate when personally asked
    - Higher quality, detailed testimonials

    **Why this works:**

    - Personal requests get better responses
    - You control who you ask (select happy customers)
    - Early shop reviews set quality standard
    - Small incentive shows appreciation

    <Tip>
      **Template email:** "Hi [Name], we noticed you've ordered from us 3 times now! Would you mind sharing your experience with other shoppers? It only takes 60 seconds: [link]. As a thank you, here's 10% off your next order."
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Growing (50-200 Reviews)">
    **Best for:** Established stores, want more shop reviews

    **Focus:** Systematic collection from loyal customers

    **Strategy:**

    1. ✅ Auto-request shop reviews from customers with 2+ orders
    2. ✅ Add shop review form to "My Account" dashboard
    3. ✅ Show "Leave a Review" prompt on order confirmation page
    4. ✅ Ask for shop reviews 30 days after first purchase
    5. ✅ Display shop reviews prominently on homepage

    **Expected results in 30 days:**

    - 30-60 new shop reviews
    - 2-4% conversion rate from requests
    - Mix of product + service feedback

    **Why this works:**

    - Targeting repeat customers (they know your brand)
    - Multiple touchpoints increase participation
    - Homepage display encourages others to review
    - Automated system scales with order volume

    <Warning>
      **Don't spam:** Only send shop review requests to customers who haven't recently received product review requests. Space them out (minimum 14 days apart).
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Maximizing (200+ Reviews)">
    **Best for:** Large stores, systematic testimonial collection

    **Focus:** Optimize collection and showcase best reviews

    **Strategy:**

    1. ✅ Segment shop review requests by customer tier (VIP, repeat, new)
    2. ✅ A/B test timing (30 days vs 60 days after first order)
    3. ✅ Feature best shop reviews in marketing (emails, ads, social)
    4. ✅ Create video testimonials from top text reviews
    5. ✅ Use shop reviews as homepage hero content
    6. ✅ Add shop review highlights to product pages

    **Expected results in 30 days:**

    - 80-150+ new shop reviews
    - 4-6% conversion rate (optimized)
    - Rich testimonials used across marketing

    **Why this works:**

    - Segmentation personalizes requests (higher response)
    - Testing finds optimal timing
    - Featured reviews encourage more submissions
    - Shop reviews become marketing asset
    - Multi-purpose use maximizes ROI

    <Check>
      **Pro move:** Turn your best shop reviews into case studies. Reach out to customers who left detailed positive reviews and ask if they'd be willing to do a short interview or video testimonial. Offer \$50-100 gift card as compensation.
