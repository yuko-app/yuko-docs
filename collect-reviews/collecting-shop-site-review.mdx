## Build Trust with Overall Shopping Experience Reviews

Shop reviews (also called Site Reviews or Store Reviews) let customers rate their entire shopping experience — not just individual products. These testimonials showcase your customer service, shipping speed, checkout experience, and overall brand quality.

**What you'll achieve:**
- Collect testimonials about overall shopping experience
- Showcase service quality and reliability
- Build trust with first-time visitors
- Highlight shipping, support, and brand values
- Display store-wide social proof on homepage

<Info>
**Impact:** Stores with shop reviews see 15-25% higher trust scores and convert 12% more first-time visitors

## Shop Reviews vs Product Reviews

Understanding the difference helps you collect the right feedback at the right time:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Product Reviews" icon="box">
    **About specific items purchased**

    - Rating for individual products
    - Focus on product quality, fit, features
    - "This shirt fits perfectly"
    - Appear on product pages
    - Best asked 7-10 days after delivery

    **Goal:** Help shoppers decide on specific products
  </Card>

  <Card title="Shop Reviews" icon="store">
    **About overall store experience**

    - Rating for entire shopping journey
    - Focus on service, shipping, checkout
    - "Great customer service and fast shipping"
    - Appear on homepage/testimonial sections
    - Best asked after multiple purchases

    **Goal:** Build overall brand trust and credibility
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Important:** Don't ask for shop reviews in first purchase emails. Wait until customers have 2-3 orders or a great service interaction. Shop reviews work best from loyal customers who know your brand.

## How to Set Up Shop Review Collection

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Settings → Review Collection Form**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Shop Reviews" icon="toggle-on">
    Navigate to the Review Collection Form settings and enable **Shop Reviews** as a collection option.

    **What this does:**
    - Adds "Leave Store Review" option to your site
    - Creates dedicated shop review submission form
    - Allows customers to review overall experience
    - Separate from product review forms
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Shop Review Form" icon="sliders">
    Configure the form fields and questions for shop reviews.

    **Recommended fields:**
    - Overall star rating (required)
    - Review text: "Tell us about your experience" (optional)
    - Reviewer name (required)

    - Would you recommend us? (Yes/No toggle)

    **Optional fields:**
    - Shipping speed rating (1-5)
    - Customer service rating (1-5)
    - Website ease of use (1-5)
    - Upload photo (optional)

    <Tip>
    **Keep it simple:** Shop review forms should be even shorter than product reviews. 3-4 fields maximum. Focus on overall rating and open-ended experience question.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Shop Review Links to Your Site" icon="link">
    Place "Leave a Review" links in strategic locations.

    **Best placements:**
    - Footer: "Rate Your Experience"
    - Thank you page after checkout
    - Order confirmation emails (for repeat customers)
    - Customer account dashboard
    - About Us page

    **Link format:**
    ```
    https://your-store.com/shop-reviews
    ```

    Yuko provides embeddable widgets and direct links.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Display Shop Reviews" icon="browser">
    Choose where to showcase your shop reviews.

    **Recommended locations:**
    - Homepage hero section (testimonial carousel)
    - About Us page (trust section)
    - Footer (trust badges)
    - Landing pages (social proof)
    - Checkout page (reassurance)

    → [Learn about display widgets](/display-reviews/introduction-to-widgets)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Encourage Shop Reviews from Loyal Customers" icon="heart">
    Strategically ask for shop reviews from your best customers.

    **When to ask:**
    - After 2-3 successful orders
    - After great customer service interaction
    - When customer contacts support with praise
    - 30 days after first purchase (for subscribers)
    - When loyalty program member reaches milestone

    <Warning>
    **Never auto-request shop reviews** to all customers like you do with product reviews. Shop reviews should be selectively requested from customers who have had enough experience with your brand.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

    **Recommended:** Stick with star ratings for consistency with product reviews.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Form Questions" icon="clipboard-question">
    **Customize what you ask in shop review forms:**

    **Essential questions:**
    - Overall experience rating (1-5 stars) - **Required**

    **Questions to avoid:**
    - Specific product questions (use product reviews instead)
    - Too many rating scales (1-2 maximum)
    - Sensitive personal information
    - Questions requiring research/effort

    <Tip>
    **Best practice:** Keep shop review forms to 3-4 fields total. The easier it is, the more testimonials you'll collect.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Thank You Message Customization" icon="message">
    **What customers see after submitting a shop review:**

    **Default message:**
    "Thank you for your review! Your feedback helps us improve."

    **Better customized messages:**

    **Friendly approach:**
    "Thank you for taking the time to share your experience! We read every review and use your feedback to serve you better. 💙"

    **Incentive approach:**
    "Thanks for your review! Check your email for a special thank you gift — 10% off your next order as our appreciation."

    **Community approach:**
    "Your review helps other shoppers discover us! Thank you for being part of our community. We appreciate you!"

    **Personalized approach:**
    "Thank you, [Name]! Your feedback means the world to our small team. We're honored to have you as a customer."

    <Check>
    **Pro tip:** If offering a thank-you discount, send it via email (not on-screen). This ensures you capture their email for future marketing.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Auto-Publish Settings" icon="circle-check">
    **Control which shop reviews appear automatically:**

    **Option 1: Auto-publish all shop reviews**
    - All submitted reviews go live immediately
    - Fastest way to build social proof
    - Risk: Negative reviews appear instantly

    **Option 2: Auto-publish 4-5 star reviews only**
    - Positive reviews appear automatically
    - Lower-rated reviews go to moderation queue
    - Balanced approach - fast positive proof, manual review of critical feedback

    **Option 3: Manual approval for all reviews**
    - You approve every shop review before it goes live
    - Most control, but slower
    - Best for: New stores, sensitive industries

    **Recommended:** Auto-publish 4-5 star shop reviews, manually review 1-3 star reviews

    → [Learn more about review moderation](/managing-reviews/review-moderation)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Display Location Settings" icon="location-dot">
    **Where shop reviews appear on your site:**

    **Dedicated shop review page:**
    - Standalone page: yourstore.com/shop-reviews
    - All store testimonials in one place
    - Good for "See what customers say" links
    - Can be added to main navigation

    **Homepage integration:**
    - Testimonial carousel widget
    - Trust badge section
    - Social proof above fold
    - Most visible placement

    **Footer integration:**
    - Small review snippet in footer
    - "Rated 4.8/5 by 500+ customers"
    - Site-wide trust signal
    - Doesn't take up main content space

    **Multiple locations (recommended):**
    - Homepage hero: Featured shop reviews carousel
    - Footer: Average rating + total reviews
    - Dedicated page: Full shop reviews archive
    - Checkout page: Trust reassurance

    <Tip>
    **Maximize impact:** Display shop reviews in 2-3 locations. Homepage gets attention, footer provides consistent trust signal, dedicated page gives detailed social proof.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verified Shop Review Badges" icon="badge-check">
    **Show which shop reviews are from verified purchasers:**

    **Verified shop reviews:**
    - Customer has completed at least one order
    - Order confirmed and delivered
    - Email verified in your system
    - Shows "Verified Customer" badge

    **Unverified shop reviews:**
    - No purchase record found
    - Submitted via public form
    - Could be from anyone (tester, friend, prospect)
    - No badge displayed

    **Settings:**
    - ✅ Show verified badge on verified reviews
    - ✅ Allow unverified shop reviews (for early testimonials)
    - ✅ Sort verified reviews higher in display
    - ❌ Hide unverified reviews (too restrictive for shop reviews)

    **Reality check:** Shop reviews are often unverified because customers use different emails or purchased as guests. That's okay — the testimonial is still valuable, just mark it appropriately.

## Shop Review Collection Strategy

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Starting Out (0-50 Reviews)">
    **Best for:** New stores, just launching shop reviews

    **Focus:** Get your first 20-30 shop reviews from best customers

    **Strategy:**
    1. ❌ Don't auto-request shop reviews from all customers yet
    2. ✅ Manually email 20-30 happy customers asking for testimonials
    3. ✅ Add "Leave a Review" link in footer
    4. ✅ Ask customers who contact support with praise
    5. ✅ Offer small thank-you (5-10% off) for shop reviews

    **Expected results in 30 days:**
    - 15-25 shop reviews
    - 3-5% response rate when personally asked
    - Higher quality, detailed testimonials

    **Why this works:**
    - Personal requests get better responses
    - You control who you ask (select happy customers)
    - Early shop reviews set quality standard
    - Small incentive shows appreciation

    <Tip>
    **Template email:**
    "Hi [Name], we noticed you've ordered from us 3 times now! Would you mind sharing your experience with other shoppers? It only takes 60 seconds: [link]. As a thank you, here's 10% off your next order."
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Growing (50-200 Reviews)">
    **Best for:** Established stores, want more shop reviews

    **Focus:** Systematic collection from loyal customers

    **Strategy:**
    1. ✅ Auto-request shop reviews from customers with 2+ orders

    3. ✅ Show "Leave a Review" prompt on order confirmation page
    4. ✅ Ask for shop reviews 30 days after first purchase

    **Expected results in 30 days:**
    - 30-60 new shop reviews
    - 2-4% conversion rate from requests
    - Mix of product + service feedback

    **Why this works:**
    - Targeting repeat customers (they know your brand)

    - Homepage display encourages others to review
    - Automated system scales with order volume

    <Warning>
    **Don't spam:** Only send shop review requests to customers who haven't recently received product review requests. Space them out (minimum 14 days apart).
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Maximizing (200+ Reviews)">
    **Best for:** Large stores, systematic testimonial collection

    **Focus:** Optimize collection and showcase best reviews

    **Strategy:**
    1. ✅ Segment shop review requests by customer tier (VIP, repeat, new)
    2. ✅ A/B test timing (30 days vs 60 days after first order)
    3. ✅ Feature best shop reviews in marketing (emails, ads, social)
    4. ✅ Create video testimonials from top text reviews
    5. ✅ Use shop reviews as homepage hero content

    **Expected results in 30 days:**

    - Featured reviews encourage more submissions
    - Shop reviews become marketing asset
    - Multi-purpose use maximizes ROI

    <Check>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When should I ask for shop reviews vs product reviews?" icon="question">
    **Different timing for different feedback types**

    **Product reviews - Ask soon after delivery:**
    - 7-10 days after product delivered
    - Customer has used the product enough to review
    - Focus on product quality, fit, features
    - Send to all customers (automated)

    **Shop reviews - Ask after customer knows your brand:**
    - After 2-3 successful orders (repeat customer)
    - 30-60 days after first purchase (enough experience)
    - After great customer service interaction
    - When customer becomes loyalty member
    - Selectively to happy customers (not automated for everyone)

    **Can I ask for both?**
    Yes, but space them out:
    - Order 1: Send product review request (7 days after delivery)
    - Order 2: Send product review request (7 days after delivery)
    - Order 3: Send shop review request (focus on overall experience)

    Or:
    - Send product review request 7 days after delivery
    - Send shop review request 30 days after first order

    <Warning>
    **Don't overwhelm:** Never send product review request and shop review request in the same week. Space them at least 14 days apart to avoid review fatigue.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should shop reviews be separate from product reviews?" icon="split">
    **It depends on your display strategy**

    **Option 1: Keep them completely separate** (recommended)
    - Shop reviews appear only in testimonial sections
    - Product reviews appear only on product pages
    - Clear distinction for customers
    - Easier to manage and display
    - Less confusing

    **Where shop reviews go:**
    - Homepage testimonial carousel
    - About Us page
    - Dedicated shop reviews page
    - Footer trust section
    - Checkout reassurance

    **Where product reviews go:**
    - Individual product pages
    - Product listing grids
    - Review widgets throughout site

    **Option 2: Combine them in some locations**
    - Show both on homepage (mixed testimonials)
    - Filter option: "Shop Reviews" vs "Product Reviews"
    - All reviews on dedicated reviews page
    - More content, but requires clear labeling

    **Recommended approach:** Keep them separate for clarity. Shop reviews are testimonials about your brand, product reviews are buying guides for specific items. Different purposes, different placements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get customers to leave detailed shop reviews?" icon="pen">
    **Most shop reviews are too brief - here's how to get detailed testimonials:**

    **1. Ask specific questions in the form:**
    Instead of: "How was your experience?"
    Ask: "What did you love most about shopping with us?"

    Other good questions:
    - "How did our product/service help you?"
    - "What made you choose us over other stores?"
    - "How was your shipping and customer service experience?"
    - "What would you tell a friend about us?"

    **2. Show examples of good reviews:**
    Display 2-3 detailed review examples above the form:
    - "Check out what Sarah shared about her experience"
    - Shows customers what "good" looks like
    - Increases average review length by 40%

    **3. Offer incentive for detailed reviews:**
    "Leave a detailed review (50+ words) and get 15% off your next order"
    - Longer reviews only (system can count words)
    - Better quality feedback
    - 2-3x more detailed testimonials

    **4. Follow up with top customers personally:**
    Email: "Hi [Name], we'd love to feature your story. Would you be willing to share more about your experience with us? We can send you a few questions, and as a thank you, here's a $25 gift card."
    - Personal outreach gets best testimonials
    - Can turn into case study or video
    - Shows you value their feedback

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** The best shop reviews come from conversations, not forms. When a customer emails you with praise, reply: "Thank you! Would you mind sharing this on our reviews page? [link]. Your words would really help other shoppers discover us."
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many shop reviews do I need to build trust?" icon="chart-line">
    **Minimum thresholds for credibility:**

    **10-20 shop reviews: Basic trust**
    - Better than nothing
    - Shows some customer validation
    - Not enough to be convincing
    - Keep collecting

    **50-100 shop reviews: Good trust level**
    - Enough for credibility
    - Shoppers feel reassured
    - Can showcase on homepage
    - Baseline for most stores

    **200-500 shop reviews: Strong trust**
    - Significant social proof
    - Comparable to competitors
    - Can feature in marketing
    - Strong conversion impact

    **500+ shop reviews: Excellent trust**
    - Major credibility signal
    - Industry leader status
    - Can be competitive advantage
    - Use as marketing asset

    **Quality matters more than quantity:**

    **Better to have:**
    - 30 detailed, 5-star shop reviews with photos
    - Than 200 brief "Great!" reviews

    **What makes shop reviews more credible:**
    - ✅ Detailed testimonials (50+ words)
    - ✅ Recent reviews (within last 6 months)
    - ✅ Mix of ratings (not all 5-stars)
    - ✅ Verified customer badges
    - ✅ Photo/video testimonials
    - ✅ Responses from store owner
    - ✅ Specific details mentioned

    <Info>
    **Reality check:** Don't wait until you have 100+ shop reviews to start displaying them. Show shop reviews as soon as you have 5-10. Seeing even a few testimonials is better than seeing none.

<Note>
**Pro tip:** Don't try to collect shop reviews from everyone. Focus on customers who have ordered 2-3 times or had exceptional service interactions. These customers know your brand well enough to give meaningful testimonials.
