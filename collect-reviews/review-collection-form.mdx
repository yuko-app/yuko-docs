## Let Customers Review Directly on Your Store

The review collection form is where customers write reviews on your website. While most reviews come from email requests (5-10% response rate), on-site forms capture 1-2% of visitors who want to leave feedback without being asked. Every review counts.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Add "Write a Review" buttons to product pages
- Collect reviews from customers browsing your store
- Customize form appearance to match your brand
- Make reviewing easy and mobile-friendly
- Capture organic reviews from happy customers

<Info>
  **Impact:** Organic reviews from on-site forms are often more detailed and authentic than email-prompted reviews

### Customer Journey

The Review Collection Form allows customers to leave feedback directly on your store. Here’s how it works step by step:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Clicks Write Review" icon="cursor">
    Customer is on a product page and clicks "Write a Review" button.

    **Where they see it:**

    - Below product description
    - In reviews section
    - After purchase confirmation
    - On "My Orders" page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Form Opens" icon="square-poll-vertical">
    Form modal or page opens with customized fields.

    **What they see:**

    - Star rating selector (1-5 stars)
    - Review title field (optional)
    - Review text area
    - Photo upload option
    - Name and email fields
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Completes Form" icon="pen">
    Customer fills in rating, writes review, optionally adds photos.

    **Typical completion time:** 2-3 minutes for text review, 4-5 minutes with photos
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Submits" icon="paper-plane">
    Review is submitted and enters your moderation queue or publishes immediately.

    **What happens:**

    - Thank you message displays
    - Review awaits approval (if manual moderation)
    - Or appears on site instantly (if auto-publish enabled)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompt for Additional Reviews" icon="list-check">

## Best Practices for High Completion

<Tabs>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Should I make review text required or optional?" icon="question">
    **Depends on your priority: quantity vs quality**

    **Make review text optional (recommended):**

    - **Pros:** 50% more reviews submitted, lower friction, more star ratings
    - **Cons:** 30% of reviews are star-only (no text), less detail
    - **Best for:** New stores, building initial review count, most products

    **Make review text required (minimum 20 characters):**

    - **Pros:** Higher quality reviews, more detailed feedback, better for SEO
    - **Cons:** 30-50% fewer submissions, some frustrated customers
    - **Best for:** Complex products needing detailed feedback, established stores with plenty of reviews

    **The hybrid approach (best of both):**

    - Make text optional
    - Add gentle encouragement: "Help others by sharing details"
    - Offer small incentive for detailed reviews (100+ characters = 5% off)
    - Show character count to encourage longer reviews
    - Display example reviews to set expectations

    <Tip>
      **Start optional, optimize later:** Begin with optional text to build review volume quickly. Once you have 50+ reviews, test requiring text on 50% of submissions to see impact.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I encourage customers to add photos?" icon="camera">
    **Make it easy and rewarding:**

    **Option 1: Offer incentive** (most effective)

    - Display reward prominently: "Add photos, get 10% off!"
    - Show reward amount above upload button
    - Send reward email immediately after submission
    - Make upload super easy (one-tap from camera roll)

    **Option 2: Social proof**

    - Show examples of good photo reviews
    - Display message: "Customers who add photos help 3x more shoppers"
    - Show photo review count: "Join 500+ photo reviewers"
    - Feature photo reviews prominently on site

    **Option 3: Make it easy**

    - One-tap photo access on mobile
    - Allow multiple photos (5+ recommended)
    - Accept all common formats (JPG, PNG, HEIC)
    - Auto-compress large files
    - Show upload progress
    - Allow photos from camera OR gallery

    **What not to do:**

    - Don't require photos (completion drops 60%)
    - Don't ask for professional photos
    - Don't limit to 1-2 photos only
    - Don't make upload process complicated

    **Expected results:**

    - No incentive: 10-15% include photos
    - With incentive: 30-40% include photos
    - With easy upload + incentive: 40-50% include photos
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can customers edit or delete reviews after submission?" icon="pen-to-square">
    **Yes - allow editing with reasonable limits**

    **Best practices for review editing:**

    **Allow edits with these rules:**

    - Customer can edit within 30 days of submission
    - Can add photos to existing review
    - Can update text or rating
    - Requires email verification to edit
    - Shows "Edited" badge if modified after approval

    **Don't allow:**

    - Deleting reviews to hide negative feedback (looks suspicious)
    - Unlimited edits (prevents abuse)
    - Editing without verification (prevents impersonation)
    - Changing verified purchase status

    **How to implement:**

    - Send "Edit Your Review" link in confirmation email
    - Add "Edit" button on review when customer is logged in
    - Require email verification for edits
    - Re-moderate if review changes significantly
    - Track edit history (internal only)

    **What about deletions?**

    - Allow deletion if customer requests it
    - Require email verification
    - Consider hiding instead of deleting (preserve data)
    - Don't delete negative reviews selectively (against policies)

    <Warning>
      **Never offer incentives to change reviews:** Don't offer discounts to customers who change negative reviews to positive. This violates platform policies and damages trust.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I handle spam and fake reviews?" icon="shield-halved">
    **Implement multiple layers of protection:**

    **Prevention measures:**

    - Require email verification
    - Check against verified purchase list
    - Use honeypot fields (invisible to humans, visible to bots)
    - Rate limit submissions (max 1 per email per product)
    - Block known spam email domains
    - Require minimum time on page (15+ seconds)

    **Detection methods:**

    - Flag reviews from non-purchasers
    - Detect duplicate text across reviews
    - Check for suspicious patterns (all 5-stars, generic text)
    - Monitor IP addresses for multiple submissions
    - Look for competitor mentions

    **Moderation queue:**

    - Manual approval for first-time reviewers
    - Auto-approve verified purchases
    - Flag reviews with external links
    - Review submissions with profanity
    - Check reviews mentioning competitors

    **After publication:**

    - Allow customers to report suspicious reviews
    - Monitor review patterns
    - Remove confirmed spam
    - Ban repeat offenders

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I collect reviews for all products or just some?" icon="boxes-stacked">
    **Enable for all products, prioritize collection for key products**

    **Enable review collection on:**

    - ✅ All products (even if no reviews yet)
    - ✅ New products (seed with early reviewers)
    - ✅ Best-sellers (maximize social proof)
    - ✅ High-consideration items (need most trust-building)
    - ✅ Products with questions (reviews answer concerns)

    **Prioritize asking for reviews on:**

    - Best-selling products (most impact)
    - High-margin products (worth the effort)
    - Products with low reviews (need initial social proof)
    - Products with high returns (understand issues)
    - New releases (build momentum)

    **Don't ask for reviews on:**

    - Gift cards (no product experience to review)
    - Digital codes (nothing to review)
    - Services without deliverable
    - Free samples or gifts

    **Strategy:**

    - Show form on all product pages
    - Email review requests for priority products
    - Send reminder emails for best-sellers
    - Offer photo rewards for visual products

    <Info>
      **Pro tip:** Products with 10-50 reviews see highest conversion lift. Focus collection efforts on products in this range to maximize ROI.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** The on-site form is important, but email review requests drive 80% of reviews. Set up both, but prioritize getting review request emails working first.
