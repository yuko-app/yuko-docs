## Let Customers Review Directly on Your Store

The review collection form is where customers write reviews on your website. While most reviews come from email requests (5-10% response rate), on-site forms capture 1-2% of visitors who want to leave feedback without being asked. Every review counts.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Add "Write a Review" buttons to product pages
- Collect reviews from customers browsing your store
- Customize form appearance to match your brand
- Make reviewing easy and mobile-friendly
- Capture organic reviews from happy customers

<Info>
  **Impact:** Organic reviews from on-site forms are often more detailed and authentic than email-prompted reviews

### Customer Journey

The Review Collection Form allows customers to leave feedback directly on your store. Here’s how it works step by step:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Clicks Write Review" icon="cursor">
    Customer is on a product page and clicks "Write a Review" button.

    **Where they see it:**

    - Below product description
    - In reviews section
    - After purchase confirmation
    - On "My Orders" page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Form Opens" icon="square-poll-vertical">

    **What they see:**

    - Star rating selector (1-5 stars)
    - Review title field (optional)

    - Photo upload option
    - Name and email fields
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Completes Form" icon="pen">
    Customer fills in rating, writes review, optionally adds photos.

    **Typical completion time:** 2-3 minutes for text review, 4-5 minutes with photos
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Submits" icon="paper-plane">
    Review is submitted and enters your moderation queue or publishes immediately.

    **What happens:**

    - Thank you message displays
    - Review awaits approval (if manual moderation)
    - Or appears on site instantly (if auto-publish enabled)
  </Step>

  </Step>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Star Rating Experience" icon="star">
    **Customize the star rating experience:**

    - **Rating Question:** Default: “How would you rate this product?”

    - **Rating Labels:**
      - 1 star (min): “Poor”, “Not great”, “Disappointed”

    - **Additional Options:**

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** The on-site form is important, but email review requests drive 80% of reviews. Set up both, but prioritize getting review request emails working first.
