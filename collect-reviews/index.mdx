## Make It Easy for Customers to Leave Reviews

Getting customer reviews requires removing all friction from the review process. The easier you make it for customers to share feedback, the more reviews you'll collect. Yuko provides multiple ways to collect reviews - through emails, on-site forms, and direct links.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Collect product reviews directly on product pages
- Gather store-wide testimonials about overall shopping experience
- Encourage photo and video reviews with visual content
- Customize review forms to match your brand
- Make reviewing fast and mobile-friendly

<Info>
  **Impact:** Stores with easy review forms collect 3-5x more reviews than those with complicated processes

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Should reviews be required or optional?" icon="question">
    **Make reviewing optional, never mandatory**

    **Why:**

    - Forced reviews create resentment
    - Quality is better when voluntary
    - Complies with platform policies
    - Feels authentic to other shoppers

    **Best approach:**

    - Send review request emails (optional to respond)
    - Add "Write a Review" option on site (not required)
    - Offer small thank-you for reviews (not payment)
    - Never block access/features for not reviewing

    **Reality check:** Even with perfect setup, only 10-25% of customers will review. That's normal and okay.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How soon after purchase should I ask for reviews?" icon="clock">
    **Depends on your product type:**

    **Fast consumables (3-7 days):**

    - Food, snacks, drinks
    - Beauty samples, skincare
    - Fast fashion accessories

    **Standard products (7-10 days):**

    - Most clothing and shoes
    - Home goods, kitchen items
    - Toys, gifts, standard electronics

    **Considered purchases (10-14 days):**

    - Furniture, large appliances
    - Tech products (need time to test)
    - Fitness equipment

    **Service-based (14-30 days):**

    - Software, subscriptions
    - Courses, education
    - Long-term products

    <Tip>
      **Start with 7 days** for most products, then adjust based on response rates. If response rate is low (less than 3%), customers may need more time.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if customers leave reviews for wrong products?" icon="shuffle">
    **This happens - here's how to handle it:**

    **Common scenarios:**

    **Scenario 1: Multi-item orders**

    - Customer bought 3 products
    - Review email includes all 3
    - Customer reviews wrong product

    **Solution:**

    - Make product name VERY clear in email
    - Use product images in review form
    - Show "You purchased this on [date]"
    - Allow customers to change product after submitting

    **Scenario 2: Similar products confused**

    - Customer owns multiple versions
    - Reviews one thinking it's another
    - Wrong product gets the review

    **Solution:**

    - You can move reviews to correct product in dashboard
    - Contact customer to verify which product
    - Edit review to clarify product

    **Scenario 3: Gift purchaser reviews**

    - Person who bought reviews instead of recipient
    - Review says "bought as gift, haven't used"
    - Not helpful for other customers

    **Solution:**

    - Ask "Did you use this product?" in review form
    - Filter out "gift purchaser" reviews from display
    - Follow up with actual user if possible
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I collect reviews for products without purchase?" icon="cart-shopping">
    **Yes, but mark them as unverified**

    **Verified purchase reviews:**

    - Customer bought from your store
    - Order ID linked to review
    - "Verified Purchase" badge shows
    - More trusted by shoppers (70% more credible)

    **Unverified reviews:**

    - Anyone can submit (customers, friends, testers)
    - No purchase proof
    - No verified badge
    - Still valuable but less trusted

    **When to allow unverified reviews:**

    - New product launches (need initial reviews)
    - Product testers/influencers
    - Friends and family purchases
    - Imported reviews from other platforms

    **Best practices:**

    - Always show verified badge when applicable
    - Allow filtering by verified/unverified
    - Don't hide unverified reviews (be transparent)
    - Prioritize verified reviews in display order

    <Warning>
      **Never fake reviews:** Don't write fake reviews or pay people who didn't purchase. This violates platform policies and damages trust when discovered.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I collect customer photos and videos?" icon="camera-movie">
    **Absolutely yes - photos increase conversions by 20%**

    **Why photo/video reviews matter:**

    - Show real-world product usage
    - Answer sizing, color, fit questions
    - Reduce returns (customers see accurate representation)
    - More authentic than professional photos
    - Increase trust dramatically

    **How to encourage visual reviews:**

    **Option 1: Offer rewards** (recommended)

    - 10% off next order for photo reviews
    - \$5 store credit for videos
    - Send "photo reward email" when photos submitted

    **Option 2: Ask politely**

    - Include "Add photos" option in review form
    - Show examples of good photos
    - Make upload super easy (one tap on mobile)

    **Option 3: Send reminder**

    - If customer submits text-only review
    - Send email 5 days later asking for photos
    - 15-25% add photos when reminded

    **Expected results:**

    - 10-15% include photos naturally
    - 30-40% include photos with rewards
    - Videos are rare (less than 5%) but very valuable

    <Tip>
      **Photo quality doesn't matter:** Authentic, real-world photos from customers convert better than professional photos, even if they're lower quality.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

    **Set up moderation and filters**

    **Common issues:**

    **Spam reviews:**

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Start with product reviews first - they're the most valuable. Once you have 50+ product reviews, then add shop reviews and custom fields. Don't overcomplicate the initial setup.
