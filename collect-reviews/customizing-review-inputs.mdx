## Collect Exactly the Feedback You Need

Customize every field in your review collection forms to match your brand voice and gather specific insights. Whether customers are submitting reviews via email or on your website, you control what information they provide and how the form looks.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Match review forms to your brand style and tone
- Collect specific feedback relevant to your products
- Control which fields are required vs optional
- Reduce form abandonment with smart field choices
- Gather richer, more detailed customer reviews

<Info>
  **Impact:** Customized review forms collect 30-40% more detailed feedback and see 20% higher completion rates than generic forms

## Why Customize Review Form Inputs

Generic review forms miss opportunities to gather valuable, specific feedback:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Generic Form Problems" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What happens with default settings:**

    - Generic placeholder text ("Write your review...")
    - Irrelevant questions for your product type
    - Too many required fields (abandonment)
    - No brand personality
    - Misses product-specific insights

    **Result:** Short, vague reviews like "Great product!"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customized Form Benefits" icon="circle-check">
    **What happens with customization:**

    - Brand-specific tone and language
    - Targeted questions for your products
    - Optimized required vs optional fields
    - Matches your site design
    - Collects actionable insights

    **Result:** Detailed reviews with specific, helpful information
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Example:** A clothing brand asking "How does it fit?" gets 3x more sizing details than asking "What do you think?" — and sizing info reduces returns by 15-25%.
