## Collect Exactly the Feedback You Need

Customize every field in your review collection forms to match your brand voice and gather specific insights. Whether customers are submitting reviews via email or on your website, you control what information they provide and how the form looks.

**What you'll achieve:**
- Match review forms to your brand style and tone
- Collect specific feedback relevant to your products
- Control which fields are required vs optional
- Reduce form abandonment with smart field choices
- Gather richer, more detailed customer reviews

<Info>
**Impact:** Customized review forms collect 30-40% more detailed feedback and see 20% higher completion rates than generic forms
</Info>

## Why Customize Review Form Inputs

Generic review forms miss opportunities to gather valuable, specific feedback:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Generic Form Problems" icon="circle-xmark">
    **What happens with default settings:**

    - Generic placeholder text ("Write your review...")
    - Irrelevant questions for your product type
    - Too many required fields (abandonment)
    - No brand personality
    - Misses product-specific insights

    **Result:** Short, vague reviews like "Great product!"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Customized Form Benefits" icon="circle-check">
    **What happens with customization:**

    - Brand-specific tone and language
    - Targeted questions for your products
    - Optimized required vs optional fields
    - Matches your site design
    - Collects actionable insights

    **Result:** Detailed reviews with specific, helpful information
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**Example:** A clothing brand asking "How does it fit?" gets 3x more sizing details than asking "What do you think?" — and sizing info reduces returns by 15-25%.

## How to Access Review Form Customization

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Settings → Review Collection Form**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Form Type" icon="toggle-on">
    Select which review form to customize:

    **Email review forms:**
    - Forms sent in review request emails
    - Customer clicks link, sees form
    - Most common review collection method

    **On-site review forms:**
    - Embedded on product pages
    - "Write a Review" button
    - Always available for customers

    **Both forms can be customized separately** or use the same settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Form Customization" icon="sliders">
    In the Review Collection Form settings, you'll see customization sections:

    - Rating display
    - Photo uploads
    - Review content fields
    - Reviewer information
    - Thank you message
    - Next product prompts
    - Footer text
    - Advanced styling (CSS)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Each Section" icon="pen">
    Work through each section, adjusting:

    - Field labels and placeholder text
    - Required vs optional settings
    - Character limits and validation rules
    - Display order and visual styling
    - Help text and examples

    **Save changes** after each section or at the end.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview Your Form" icon="eye">
    Use the preview function to see how your form looks:

    - Desktop view
    - Mobile view
    - Email vs on-site versions
    - Test form submission

    **Test thoroughly** before going live.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch and Monitor" icon="rocket">
    Activate your customized review form and track results:

    - Completion rate (target: 60%+)
    - Average review length (target: 50+ words)
    - Photo upload rate (target: 15-30%)
    - Time to complete (target: under 2 minutes)

    **Adjust based on data** — if completion rate drops, you may have too many required fields.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Review Form Customization Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rating Field Customization" defaultOpen icon="star">

    **Rating label customization:**

    **Default labels:**

    - 5 stars: "Outstanding quality"

    **Fun/playful brand:**

    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Photo & Video Upload Settings" icon="camera">
    **Allow customers to upload visual content:**

    **Photo upload options:**
    - Maximum photos per review (1-10, recommended: 5)
    - Required vs optional (recommended: optional)
    - Accepted file types (JPG, PNG, HEIC, WebP)
    - Maximum file size (recommended: 10MB per photo)
    - Auto-resize/compression settings

    **Video upload options:**
    - Allow video uploads (Yes/No)
    - Maximum video length (recommended: 30-60 seconds)
    - Maximum video file size (recommended: 50MB)
    - Accepted formats (MP4, MOV, WebM)

    **Upload field customization:**

    **Default text:**
    "Add photos (optional)"

    **Better custom text:**
    - "Show us how you use it! (optional)" — encouraging
    - "Upload photos for 10% off your next order" — incentivized
    - "Help other shoppers see it in real life" — social proof
    - "Add photos of you wearing/using [product]" — specific

    **Display settings:**
    - Photo upload button placement (top, bottom, inline)
    - Example photos shown (good photo guidance)
    - Mobile camera direct upload (one-tap from camera roll)
    - Drag-and-drop support (desktop)

    **Photo incentives:**
    If offering rewards for photos:
    - "Upload a photo and get 10% off your next order!"
    - Explain reward clearly in upload section
    - Auto-detect photo uploads for discount code

    <Check>
    **Best practice:** Make photos optional but incentivized. Requiring photos reduces completion rate by 40%, but offering 10% off increases photo uploads from 10% to 35%.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Content Fields" icon="pen-to-square">
    **Customize the text fields where customers write reviews:**

    - Minimum character count (recommended: 20-50 characters if required)

    **Beauty/skincare:**

    - "Any tips for other shoppers?"

    <Tip>

    **What customers see after submitting their review:**

    **Default message:**
    "Thank you for your review! We appreciate your feedback."

    **Better customized messages:**

    **Appreciation approach:**
    "Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience! Your feedback helps other shoppers and helps us improve. We truly appreciate you! 💙"

    **Incentive approach:**
    "Thanks for your review! Check your email in the next 5 minutes for a special thank you gift — 10% off your next order."

    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Next Product Review Prompts" icon="forward">
    **Encourage customers to review multiple products from their order:**

    **When to use:**
    - Customer ordered 2+ products
    - Customer just reviewed one product
    - Other products not yet reviewed

    **Settings:**

    **Enable next product prompts:**
    - Show after review submission (Yes/No)
    - Only for multi-item orders (recommended: Yes)
    - Maximum prompts to show (1-3 products)

    **Prompt message customization:**

    **Default:**
    "Want to review another product?"

    **Better custom messages:**
    - "You also purchased [Product]. Want to review that too?"
    - "Thanks! Got 30 more seconds to review [Product]?"
    - "One more? Help shoppers learn about [Product]"

    **Display format:**
    - Show product image + name
    - "Review [Product]" button
    - "No thanks" / "Maybe later" option

    **Why this matters:**
    - 20-30% of customers review additional products when prompted
    - Increases reviews per order from 1.0 to 1.3-1.5
    - Captures feedback while customer is engaged
    - More efficient than sending separate emails

    **Best practices:**
    - Only prompt for 1-2 additional products (not all 5)
    - Show products customer most likely wants to review (higher price items, new releases)
    - Allow easy opt-out ("No thanks, I'm done")
    - Don't require additional reviews

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** If customer reviews 2+ products in one session, send them an extra special thank you email with a larger discount (15-20% off) as appreciation for their time.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advanced CSS Styling" icon="paintbrush">
    **Customize form design to perfectly match your brand:**

    **What you can style:**
    - Form background color
    - Input field borders and backgrounds
    - Button colors and hover states
    - Font family, size, and colors
    - Spacing and padding
    - Mobile responsive breakpoints

    **Common CSS customizations:**

    **Match your brand colors:**
    ```css
    /* Primary button - your brand color */
    .yuko-submit-button {
      background-color: #685eef;
      color: #ffffff;
      border-radius: 8px;
    }

    /* Star rating - your accent color */
    .yuko-rating-star.selected {
      color: #685eef;
    }
    ```

    **Custom fonts:**
    ```css
    /* Match your site typography */
    .yuko-review-form {
      font-family: 'Your-Font', sans-serif;
    }
    ```

    **Spacing adjustments:**
    ```css
    /* Tighter mobile spacing */
    @media (max-width: 768px) {
      .yuko-form-field {
        margin-bottom: 15px;
      }
    }
    ```

    **Form layout:**
    ```css
    /* Full-width on mobile */
    @media (max-width: 768px) {
      .yuko-review-form {
        max-width: 100%;
        padding: 20px 15px;
      }
    }
    ```

    **When to use custom CSS:**
    - Your brand has specific colors not available in settings
    - You want custom spacing/layout
    - You need specific mobile optimizations
    - You want unique hover/focus states

    **When NOT to use custom CSS:**
    - You can achieve it with basic settings (use those instead)
    - You're not familiar with CSS (risk breaking layout)
    - You want the default Yuko styling (it's already optimized)

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Start with default styling and only add custom CSS for specific brand elements (colors, fonts). Over-customization can break mobile responsiveness.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Should I make review text required or optional?" icon="question">
    **Recommended: Make review text optional**

    **Why optional is better:**

    **Completion rate:**
    - Required text: 40-50% completion rate
    - Optional text: 70-80% completion rate
    - 30-40% more reviews with optional text

    **Quality:**
    - Required text often results in low-effort "Great product!" reviews
    - Optional text means those who write WANT to share (better quality)
    - 5-star ratings without text are still valuable social proof

    **Customer experience:**
    - Not everyone has time to write detailed reviews
    - Some customers prefer quick star rating
    - Forcing text creates friction and resentment

    **What to do instead:**
    - Make review text optional
    - Add helpful prompts to encourage detailed responses
    - Offer incentive for longer reviews (50+ words)
    - Show example reviews to guide customers

    **Example approach:**
    - Rating: Required
    - Review text: Optional, with placeholder prompts
    - Photos: Optional, with incentive
    - Bonus: "Write 50+ words for 15% off your next order"

    **Results:**
    - 70-80% leave star rating
    - 40-50% also write text
    - 20-30% upload photos (with incentive)
    - Overall: More total reviews, good text quality from those who engage

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Track your completion rate. If it drops below 60%, you have too many required fields. Remove requirements until completion rate is 70%+.

  <Accordion title="How many custom fields should I add?" icon="sliders">
    **Recommended: 2-3 custom fields maximum**

    **Field count impact on completion rate:**

    **3-5 total fields: 75-80% completion** ✅ Optimal
    - Star rating (required)
    - Review text (optional)
    - Name (required)
    - Email (required)
    - Photos (optional)

    **6-8 total fields: 60-70% completion** ⚠️ Acceptable
    - All basic fields above
    - +1-2 custom questions (dropdowns)
    - Still manageable

    **9-12 total fields: 40-50% completion** ❌ Too many
    - Basic fields
    - +4-6 custom questions
    - Feels like a survey
    - High abandonment

    **13+ fields: 20-30% completion** ❌ Way too many
    - Customers give up
    - Only most motivated complete
    - Not worth the lost reviews

    **What custom fields to add:**

    **High value (add these):**
    - Fit/sizing (for clothing)
    - Skin type (for beauty)
    - "Would you recommend?" (any product)

    **Medium value (add if relevant):**
    - How long used (supplements, tech)
    - Age range (some products)
    - Use case (versatile products)

    **Low value (skip these):**
    - Occupation (rarely relevant)
    - Detailed demographics (too personal)
    - Multiple rating scales (confusing)

    **Best practice:**
    Start with basic fields only. After 50+ reviews, analyze what information is missing. Add 1-2 custom fields based on actual needs. Monitor completion rate.

    <Warning>
    **Every extra field costs reviews:** Each additional required field reduces completion rate by 5-10%. Only add custom fields if the information is worth losing reviews over.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have different forms for different product types?" icon="split">
    **Yes — and you should for very different product categories**

    **When to use different forms:**

    **Scenario 1: Different product categories**
    - Store sells clothing AND electronics
    - Clothing needs "How does it fit?" field
    - Electronics needs "Ease of setup" field
    - Solution: Create separate forms per category

    **Scenario 2: Different price points**
    - Low-price items (under $20): Quick form (3 fields)
    - High-price items (over $100): Detailed form (5-6 fields)
    - Customers more willing to write detailed reviews for expensive purchases

    **Scenario 3: Different customer segments**
    - B2C customers: Simple, friendly tone
    - B2B customers: Professional, detailed questions
    - Different language and expectations

    **How to set up multiple forms:**

    **In Yuko:**
    1. Create default review form (used for most products)
    2. Create custom forms for specific categories
    3. Assign forms to product categories or tags
    4. System uses category-specific form when available

    **Example setup:**
    - Default form: 5 fields, general questions
    - Clothing form: + "How does it fit?" dropdown
    - Beauty form: + "Skin type" and "Results" fields
    - Food form: + "Taste rating" and "Recipe ideas"

    **When NOT to use different forms:**
    - All products are similar (e.g., only selling shoes)
    - Small store (under 50 products) - not worth complexity
    - Testing phase (start with one form, optimize later)

    <Check>
    **Pro tip:** Start with ONE optimized form for your main product type. Only create multiple forms once you have 100+ reviews and see clear need for category-specific questions.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I require email addresses in review forms?" icon="envelope">
    **Yes — always collect email (but explain why)**

    **Why require email:**

    **Verification:**
    - Match review to order (verified purchase badge)
    - Reduces fake/spam reviews by 90%
    - Shows "Verified Customer" on reviews
    - Builds trust with other shoppers

    **Communication:**
    - Thank reviewer personally
    - Send discount code for photo reviews
    - Follow up if review needs clarification
    - Request permission to feature review

    **Anti-spam:**
    - Block known spam email domains
    - Prevent duplicate reviews from same person
    - Identify competitor fake reviews
    - Maintain review quality

    **How to require email without friction:**

    **Bad approach:**
    "Email address" (required)
    - No explanation
    - Customers wonder why
    - Feels invasive

    **Good approach:**
    "Email (won't be shown publicly)"
    - Reassures privacy
    - Clear it's hidden
    - Less resistance

    **Best approach:**
    "Email address (for verification only — never displayed)"
    - Explains purpose
    - Privacy commitment
    - Transparent

    **Settings to enable:**
    - ✅ Require email
    - ✅ Hide email from public display (always)
    - ✅ Use for verified purchase matching
    - ✅ Allow customers to opt-out of marketing emails
    - ✅ Link to privacy policy

    **Email validation:**
    - Check format (valid email structure)
    - Block disposable email domains (tempmail, etc.)
    - Verify email exists (optional, can reduce completion)
    - Match to customer database (for verified badge)

    **What NOT to do:**
    - ❌ Display emails publicly on reviews
    - ❌ Auto-opt-in to marketing without consent
    - ❌ Share emails with third parties
    - ❌ Require email verification before review publishes (adds friction)

    <Warning>
    **Privacy compliance:** Always include a checkbox for marketing opt-in (separate from review submission). Pre-checked opt-ins violate GDPR and other privacy laws.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I encourage longer, more detailed reviews?" icon="pen">
    **Strategies to get detailed, helpful reviews instead of brief comments:**

    **1. Show helpful prompts in placeholder text:**

    **Instead of:**
    "Write your review here..."

    **Use specific prompts:**
    - "How's the quality? How does it fit? What do you love about it?"
    - "What results did you see? How long have you been using it?"
    - "Was it easy to set up? How's the performance? Would you recommend it?"

    **Result:** 35-40% longer reviews with specific prompts

    **2. Offer incentives for detailed reviews:**

    **Incentive examples:**
    - "Write 50+ words and get 15% off your next order"
    - "Detailed reviews (3+ sentences) receive $5 store credit"
    - "Share a helpful review and enter our monthly $100 giveaway"

    **Implementation:**
    - Auto-detect word count on submission
    - Provide bonus code immediately or via email
    - Thank customers for detailed feedback

    **Result:** 2-3x more detailed reviews, average length 80-120 words

    **3. Show example reviews:**

    **Above the review form, display 2-3 featured reviews:**
    - "See what other customers shared:"
    - Show 4-5 star reviews with photos and detailed text
    - Demonstrates what "good" looks like

    **Result:** Customers mimic the quality they see

    **4. Ask specific follow-up questions:**

    **Instead of one big text box:**
    - "What did you love most?" (text field)
    - "Any suggestions for improvement?" (text field)
    - "Tips for other shoppers?" (text field)

    **Multiple small questions feel easier than one big essay**

    **Result:** 50% more detailed feedback from specific questions

    **5. Make it conversational and easy:**

    **Formal tone (bad):**
    "Please provide a comprehensive review of the product, including details about quality, functionality, and overall satisfaction."

    **Friendly tone (good):**
    "Tell other shoppers about your experience! What do you love? How do you use it? Any tips to share?"

    **Result:** Friendly tone increases review length by 25%

    **6. Send reminder emails for text:**

    **If customer submits only star rating:**
    - Send email 3-5 days later
    - "Thanks for your rating! Want to add a few words to help other shoppers?"
    - 15-20% add text when reminded

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Combine multiple strategies. Show example reviews + use specific prompts + offer incentive for 50+ words = 3-4x more detailed, helpful reviews.
    </Tip>

  <Accordion title="Can customers edit their reviews after submitting?" icon="pen-to-square">
    **Yes — and you should allow it (with limits)**

    **Why allow review editing:**

    **Honest mistakes:**
    - Customer rates wrong product
    - Typos or incorrect information
    - Changed opinion after more use
    - Wants to add photos later

    **Better accuracy:**
    - Updated reviews are more accurate
    - Customer can add to review after more experience
    - Can clarify if store responds to concern

    **Customer satisfaction:**
    - Shows you trust customers
    - Flexibility builds goodwill
    - Reduces support requests ("How do I change my review?")

    **How to implement review editing:**

    **Settings:**
    - Allow editing: Yes (recommended)
    - Edit time limit: 30-90 days after submission
    - Editing restrictions: Can't change after merchant responds
    - Edit history: Track changes (visible to admin only)

    **Customer flow:**
    1. Customer submits review
    2. Receives confirmation email with "Edit review" link
    3. Can click to make changes within time limit
    4. Changes save, review updates on site

    **What customers can edit:**
    - ✅ Star rating
    - ✅ Review text
    - ✅ Add/remove photos
    - ✅ Change reviewer name display
    - ❌ Cannot change email (prevents abuse)

    **Restrictions to prevent abuse:**

    **Time limit:**
    - 30 days: Standard (recommended)
    - 90 days: Generous
    - Unlimited: Not recommended (abuse risk)

    **Lock after merchant response:**
    - If you reply to a review, lock editing
    - Prevents customers from changing review after your response
    - Maintains conversation integrity

    **Edit tracking:**
    - Log all edits (admin view)
    - Show "Edited" badge on review (optional)
    - Detect suspicious editing patterns

    **Potential issues and solutions:**

    **Issue:** Customer changes 5-star to 1-star months later
    **Solution:** Time limit (30-90 days max)

    **Issue:** Customer edits review after you respond
    **Solution:** Lock editing after merchant response

    **Issue:** Customer keeps editing repeatedly
    **Solution:** Limit to 2-3 edits maximum

    <Check>
    **Best practice:** Allow editing for 30 days, lock after merchant response, limit to 3 edits. This balances customer flexibility with preventing abuse.
