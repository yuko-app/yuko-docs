## Understanding Your Review System

Here's how Yuko works after setup:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Customers Receive Review Requests" defaultOpen icon="paper-plane">
    **The automatic flow:**

    1. Customer places an order on your store
    2. You mark the order as "Completed" (delivered)
    3. Yuko waits 7 days (you control this timing)
    4. Customer receives email with link to review form
    5. Customer clicks link and writes review
    6. Review appears in your Yuko Dashboard

    **No manual work needed** - This happens automatically for every order.

    <Tip>
      **Best timing:** Most stores send review requests 7-10 days after delivery. This gives customers time to use the product.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How Reviews Appear on Your Store" icon="store">
    **After a customer submits a review:**

    - **Auto-Publish ON:** Review shows on your store immediately
    - **Auto-Publish OFF:** You approve the review first, then it shows

    **Where reviews appear:**

    - Product pages (where customers make buying decisions)
    - Star ratings (on product listings)
    - Homepage carousel (showcase best reviews)
    - Review collection page (all reviews in one place)

    → [Learn about review displays](/displayReviews/index)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to Collect More Reviews" icon="chart-line">
    **After your first reviews arrive, increase your collection rate:**

    - **Add reminder emails** - Send a gentle reminder to customers who didn't respond (adds 50% more reviews)
    - **Offer small rewards** - Give 10% discount for reviews with photos (doubles photo review rate)
    - **Reply to reviews** - Thank customers publicly (encourages more reviews)
    - **Make it easy** - Mobile-friendly form = more responses

    **Expected results:**

    - Without optimization: 5-10% of customers leave reviews
    - With reminders + rewards: 15-25% of customers leave reviews

    → [Advanced collection strategies](/requestReviews/index)
  </Accordion>
