![Image9 Pn](/images/image9.png)

### The Automatic Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Submits Review" icon="pen">
    Customer writes a review on your store (positive, neutral, or negative).

    **Any rating:** This email works for all reviews, regardless of star rating.
  </Step>

  <Step title="You Reply in Dashboard" icon="reply">
    You read the review and write a thoughtful reply in the Yuko Dashboard.

    **Public reply:** Your response appears on your store for everyone to see.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Yuko Detects Reply" icon="bell">
    Yuko automatically detects that you added a reply to a customer's review.

    **Smart tracking:** Only sends email when reply is published (not saved as draft).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Email Sends to Reviewer" icon="envelope">
    Customer receives email notification that you replied to their review.

    **Timing:** Instant or delayed (your choice - default is 1 day later).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customer Sees Your Reply" icon="eye">
    Customer clicks link in email and reads your response on your store.

    **Engagement:** Many customers update their review or make another purchase after seeing your reply.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why This Matters

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Most Reviewers Never Return" icon="user-clock">
    **The problem with replies:**

    - Customer leaves review and moves on
    - You reply publicly on your store
    - But original reviewer never visits again
    - They never see you acknowledged them
    - Wasted opportunity to connect

    **This email solves it:** Brings them back to see your reply
  </Card>

  <Card title="Shows You Care" icon="heart">
    **Builds emotional connection:**

    - "They actually read my review!"
    - "They took time to respond personally"
    - "My feedback matters to them"
    - "This is a company that cares"

    **Result:** Customer feels valued and appreciated
  </Card>

  <Card title="Turns Negatives into Positives" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Handle complaints professionally:**

    - Acknowledge negative reviews
    - Apologize and offer solution
    - Customer receives notification
    - Many update review or give second chance

    **Result:** Recovery from bad experiences
  </Card>

  <Card title="Encourages Advocacy" icon="users">
    **Creates brand advocates:**

    - Customer sees you reply to everyone
    - Impressed by responsiveness
    - Tells friends about good experience

## Email Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Timing: When to Send Notification" icon="clock" defaultOpen>
    **Setting:** Notify After

    **What it means:** When should the notification email send after you publish your reply?

    **Options:**

    | Timing | When to Use | Why |
    |--------|-------------|-----|
    | Instantly | High-touch customer service approach | Customer sees reply within minutes, feels immediate attention |
    | 1 day (recommended) | Most businesses | Gives you time to batch replies, less overwhelming |
    | Custom delay | Special workflows | Match your customer service schedule |

    **Why 1-day delay works:**
    - You can reply to multiple reviews in one session
    - Customer gets digest of all your replies (if they left multiple reviews)
    - Less email bombardment
    - Still fast enough to feel responsive

    <Tip>
    **Recommended:** Use 1-day delay unless you're specifically focused on immediate customer service. It balances responsiveness with customer inbox management.
    </Tip>

    <Warning>
    **Don't delay too long:** More than 3 days and customers forget they left a review. Keep it within 1-2 days for best engagement.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Subject Line: Make it Personal" icon="envelope">
    **Setting:** Email Subject

    **Best practices for reply notification subjects:**

    ✅ **Good reply notification subjects:**
    - "[Your Name] replied to your review"
    - "Thanks for your feedback, [First Name]!"
    - "We responded to your [Product] review"
    - "About your review of [Product]..."

    ❌ **Avoid:**
    - "New notification" (too vague)
    - "Review reply" (too corporate)
    - "Your review has a response" (too formal)
    - No subject personalization (missed opportunity)

    **Key elements:**
    - Include your store name or personal name
    - Mention "reply" or "response" clearly
    - Reference the product if possible
    - Keep it warm and personal, not robotic

    <Info>
    **Personal touch:** Using your actual name ("Sarah replied to your review") feels more human than "[Store Name] replied."
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Message: Show Appreciation" icon="message">
    **Setting:** Message Body

    **What makes a good reply notification email:**

    **Structure:**
    1. Thank them for their feedback
    2. Let them know you replied
    3. Include preview of your reply (optional)
    4. Link to see full reply and conversation

    **Example structure:**
    ```
    Hi {{review_author_name}},

    Thank you so much for taking the time to review {{review_product_name}}!

    We wanted to let you know that we've personally responded to your review. You can read our reply and continue the conversation on your product page:

    [View Your Review and Our Reply]

    We truly appreciate your feedback and hope to serve you again soon!

    Best regards,
    [Your Name]
    [Store Name]
    ```

    **What to include:**
    - Genuine thank you
    - Brief mention they received a reply
    - Clear call-to-action to view reply
    - Personal sign-off (not "The Team")

    **What NOT to do:**
    - ❌ Copy entire reply in email (save it for the site)
    - ❌ Generic corporate language
    - ❌ Make it transactional
    - ❌ Forget to link back to the review

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Sign with a real person's name, not "Customer Service Team." Personal replies feel more authentic and build stronger connections.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reply Preview: Show or Hide?" icon="eye">
    **Setting:** Reply Visibility

    **Should you include your reply in the email?**

    ### Option 1: Short Preview (Recommended)
    **Show first 2-3 lines of your reply**

    **Pros:**
    - Gives context without spoiling everything
    - Entices customer to click and read more
    - Confirms this is real (not spam)
    - Still drives traffic to your site

    **Best for:** Most stores - balances engagement with traffic

    ---

    ### Option 2: No Preview
    **Just notify, don't show reply**

    **Pros:**
    - Maximum curiosity (must click to see)
    - Drives highest click-through rate
    - Keeps conversation on your site

    **Cons:**
    - Less context in email
    - Some customers won't bother clicking

    **Best for:** Stores wanting maximum site traffic

    ---

    ### Option 3: Full Reply
    **Show your entire reply in email**

    **Pros:**
    - Customer reads reply without clicking
    - Convenient for customer

    **Cons:**
    - No reason to visit site
    - Miss opportunity for re-engagement
    - Loses conversion potential

    **Best for:** Pure customer service focus (not recommended for most stores)

    <Info>
    **Sweet spot:** Use short preview (2-3 lines) to give context while still driving click-throughs to your site.

## Best Practices for Replying to Reviews

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Reply to EVERY Review" icon="comment-dots">
    **Yes, every single one**

    **Why reply to all reviews:**
    - Shows you read every piece of feedback
    - Positive reviews: Thank customer publicly
    - Negative reviews: Show you care about problems
    - Neutral reviews: Opportunity to connect
    - Other customers see you're responsive

    **How to manage:**
    - Set aside 15-30 minutes daily
    - Reply to yesterday's reviews
    - Use templates for common types
    - Keep replies brief (2-4 sentences)

    **What if you get 100+ reviews per week?**
    - Reply to all negative reviews (priority)
    - Reply to detailed positive reviews (selective)
    - Thank reviews with photos (selective)
    - Consider hiring customer service help

    <Tip>
    **80/20 rule:** If you can't reply to all reviews, prioritize negatives (handle complaints) and photo reviews (reward effort). This covers 80% of the value with 20% of the work.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Personalize Every Reply" icon="user">
    **Never use generic templates verbatim**

    **What to personalize:**
    - Use customer's name
    - Reference specific product
    - Mention something from their review
    - Acknowledge their specific concern or praise

    **Template vs Personal:**

    ❌ **Generic template:**
    "Thank you for your review! We appreciate your feedback. Come back soon!"

    ✅ **Personalized reply:**
    "Hi Sarah! So glad the blue floral dress fit perfectly for your sister's wedding! Thanks for the photo - you look amazing. We hope to see you back for summer collection!"

    **Why it matters:**
    - Shows you actually read their review
    - Builds real connection
    - Demonstrates authenticity
    - Encourages repeat business

    <Info>
    **Save time with templates:** Create reply templates for common scenarios (positive, negative, neutral), but ALWAYS customize with customer's name and specific details from their review.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle Negative Reviews with Care" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Your reply is public - others are watching**

    **The golden formula for negative reviews:**

    1. **Thank them** - "Thank you for bringing this to our attention"
    2. **Apologize** - "We're sorry you had this experience"
    3. **Take responsibility** - Don't make excuses or blame customer
    4. **Offer solution** - "We'd like to make this right..."
    5. **Take offline if needed** - "Please email us at..."

    **Example negative review reply:**
    ```
    Hi John,

    Thank you for your honest feedback about the shipping delay. We sincerely apologize - that's definitely not the experience we want you to have.

    I see your order was delayed due to our carrier issues. I've just sent you an email with a refund for the shipping cost and a 20% discount on your next order.

    We'd love the chance to earn back your trust. Please reach out to support@store.com if there's anything else we can do.

    - Sarah
    ```

    **What NOT to do:**
    - ❌ Argue or defend yourself
    - ❌ Blame the customer
    - ❌ Ignore or delete the review
    - ❌ Ask them to remove/change review in exchange for refund
    - ❌ Be defensive or sarcastic

    <Warning>
    **Never delete honest negative reviews:** It damages trust. Reply professionally instead - it shows other customers you handle problems well.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reply Timing Strategy" icon="calendar">
    **When to write your replies:**

    **Best practice schedule:**
    - Check reviews once daily (morning or evening)
    - Reply to all new reviews from yesterday
    - Negative reviews: Reply within 24 hours (priority)
    - Positive reviews: Reply within 48 hours (still good)

    **Why batch replies:**
    - More efficient than replying one-by-one
    - Maintains consistent tone/quality
    - Less mental context-switching
    - Easier to spot patterns/trends

    **Urgency levels:**

    | Review Type | Reply Speed | Why |
    |------------|-------------|-----|
    | 1-2 star negative | Within 24 hours | Damage control, show you care |
    | 3 star neutral | Within 48 hours | Opportunity to improve experience |
    | 4-5 star positive | Within 72 hours | Thank them, build relationship |
    | Photo reviews | Within 48 hours | Reward the extra effort |

    <Tip>
    **Set calendar reminder:** Block 15-30 minutes daily for "review replies" - makes it a habit instead of forgotten task.
    </Tip>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do customers actually read reply notifications?" icon="envelope-open">
    **Yes, at much higher rates than other emails**

    **Open rates:**
    - Average promotional email: 15-20% open rate
    - Review reply notification: 40-60% open rate
    - Negative review replies: 60-80% open rate

    **Why such high engagement:**
    - Personal to them (about THEIR review)
    - Unexpected (most stores don't reply)
    - Curiosity (what did they say?)
    - Investment (they already took time to review)

    **What they do after opening:**
    - 50-70% click through to view full reply on site
    - 20-30% browse other products while there
    - 10-15% make another purchase within 30 days
    - Many update their review or leave more detailed feedback

    <Info>
    **High ROI activity:** Replying to reviews (and notifying customers) has one of the highest customer retention ROIs - costs almost nothing, builds loyalty significantly.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I reply to positive reviews or just negatives?" icon="question">
    **BOTH - but with different approaches**

    **Positive reviews (4-5 stars):**

    **Why reply:**
    - Thank them publicly
    - Reinforce positive behavior
    - Show other customers you're engaged
    - Build loyalty for repeat purchases

    **How to reply:**
    - Brief thank you (2-3 sentences)
    - Personalize with their name
    - Reference specific product or detail
    - Invite them back

    **Example:** "Thanks Sarah! So happy you love the blue dress. Your photo looks amazing! Come back for our summer collection 😊"

    ---

    **Negative reviews (1-3 stars):**

    **Why reply:**
    - Damage control (show others you care)
    - Opportunity to fix problem
    - Prevent customer churn
    - Demonstrate professionalism

    **How to reply:**
    - Longer, more detailed (4-6 sentences)
    - Apologize sincerely
    - Offer concrete solution
    - Take conversation offline if complex

    **Example:** "Hi John, we sincerely apologize for the sizing issue. I've emailed you directly to arrange a free return and sent a discount for your next order. We'd love to make this right..."

    <Tip>
    **Priority:** If short on time, reply to ALL negatives and SOME positives. Negatives have higher business impact, but positives build relationships.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if customer updates their review after my reply?" icon="pen-nib">
    **This happens and it's usually good news**

    **Common scenarios:**

    **Scenario 1: Positive outcome**
    - You replied to negative review
    - Offered solution or refund
    - Customer appreciates response
    - **Updates review from 2 stars to 4-5 stars**
    - Adds "Update: They fixed the issue!" to review

    **Scenario 2: Additional details**
    - You replied with helpful information
    - Customer tries your suggestion
    - **Updates review with results**
    - Thanks you publicly in the update

    **Scenario 3: Photos added**
    - You replied thanking them
    - They didn't include photos initially
    - **Returns and adds photos after your reply**
    - Feels more connected to your brand

    **Should you send another notification?**
    - No - don't spam them with another email
    - Your original reply still stands
    - They'll see any new replies when they update

    <Info>
    **Win-win:** When customers update reviews after your reply, it shows other shoppers that you actually solve problems and care about feedback.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I disable notifications for specific reviews?" icon="toggle-off">
    **Yes, with manual workflow control**

    **Why you might skip notifications:**
    - Spam or fake reviews (removing anyway)
    - Internal testing reviews
    - Replied but it's a sensitive situation
    - Customer already contacted you offline

    **How to handle:**
    - Reply to review in dashboard
    - Choose "Don't notify customer" option (if available)
    - OR: Disable email before replying, re-enable after
    - OR: Use manual approval for replies

    **Default recommendation:**
    - Enable notifications for 95%+ of replies
    - Only skip for exceptional circumstances
    - Most customers appreciate notification

    <Warning>
    **Don't overthink it:** Unless there's a specific reason not to notify, always send the notification. Customers appreciate knowing you replied.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I reply to multiple reviews from same customer?" icon="clone">
    **Yuko handles this intelligently**

    **Scenario: Customer reviewed 3 products in one order**
    - You reply to Product A review
    - Customer gets notification about Product A
    - You reply to Product B review
    - Customer gets notification about Product B
    - You reply to Product C review
    - Customer gets notification about Product C

    **Is this too many emails?**

    **Two approaches:**

    **Option 1: Send individual notifications** (default)
    - Each review gets its own notification
    - Clear which product you're responding to
    - Higher engagement per review

    **Option 2: Batch notifications**
    - Combine multiple reply notifications if within same day
    - "We replied to your 3 reviews!" single email
    - Less inbox clutter
    - Slightly lower engagement

    **Recommended:** Use 1-day delay and Yuko will automatically batch replies from same day into one email if multiple reviews from same customer.

    <Tip>
    **Natural batching:** If you set notification to 1-day delay and reply to all reviews in one session, customers with multiple reviews get one email with all your replies. Problem solved automatically.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I include an incentive in my reply?" icon="gift">
    **Depends on the review type**

    **Negative reviews (1-3 stars):**

    **Yes, offer compensation:**
    - Shows you take responsibility
    - Gives customer reason to try again
    - Public gesture of goodwill
    - Often results in review update

    **Example:** "We've sent you 20% off your next order and refunded shipping. We'd love to earn back your trust."

    **Typical compensation:** 15-25% off, free shipping, or store credit

    ---

    **Positive reviews (4-5 stars):**

    **Usually no - but can be strategic:**

    **Don't offer incentive if:**
    - Just saying thank you (no incentive needed)
    - Standard positive review
    - Already rewarded for photo review

    **Do offer incentive if:**
    - Exceptional review (detailed, photos, videos)
    - Influential reviewer (large following)
    - Want to encourage repeat purchase
    - Customer went above and beyond

    **Example:** "Your detailed review with photos is amazing! As a thank-you, here's 10% off your next order..."

    **Typical reward:** 10-15% off

    <Warning>
    **Don't incentivize all positive reviews:** This trains customers to expect discounts for reviews, which is expensive and potentially violates platform policies.
    </Warning>

## Need Help?

<snippet file="need-help.mdx" />

<Note>
**Pro tip:** Replying to reviews (especially negative ones) publicly shows potential customers that you care about feedback and handle problems professionally. This builds more trust than having only 5-star reviews with no replies.
</Note>
