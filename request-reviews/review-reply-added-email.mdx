## Email Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Timing: When to Send Notification" defaultOpen icon="clock">
    **Setting: Days after to notify a reply**

    **Navigation: **Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Emails → Review Reply Added Email → Edit → Settings**

    ![Ss](/images/ss.png)

    **What this setting does**

    Controls how many days YUKO waits **after a reply is added to a customer’s review** before notifying the customer by email.

    This notification lets customers know their feedback has been seen and responded to.

    **Default value:** 1 day

    ### When to use this setting

    | Delay                   | When to use               | Why                                           |
    | :---------------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
    | **1 day (recommended)** | Most stores               | Timely notification without feeling intrusive |
    | **2–3 days**            | High review volume stores | Avoids frequent notifications                 |
    | **0 days**              | ❌ Not recommended         | Can feel immediate and disruptive             |

    **Best practice:**\
    A short delay keeps the interaction human and thoughtful, rather than automated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Subject Line: Make it Personal" icon="envelope">
    **Setting:** Email Subject

    ### What this setting does

    Defines the subject line shown in the customer’s inbox when a reply is added to their review.

    ---

    ### Best practices for reply notification subject lines

    Subjects should feel personal and appreciative, not transactional.

    #### ✅ Recommended examples

    - \_We replied to your review on \_
    - \_Thanks for your feedback on \_
    - _Your review has a new reply_
    - _We’ve responded to your review_

    #### ❌ Avoid

    - Urgent or promotional language
    - Discount-related wording
    - Vague system messages (“Notification update”)

    <Info>
      **Personal touch:** Using your actual name ("Sarah replied to your review") feels more human than "[Store Name] replied."
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview Text" icon="message">
    ### What this setting does

    Controls the short line of text shown next to the subject line in inboxes.

## Best Practices for Replying to Reviews

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Reply to EVERY Review" icon="comment-dots">
    **Yes, every single one**

    **Why reply to all reviews:**

    - Shows you read every piece of feedback
    - Positive reviews: Thank customer publicly
    - Negative reviews: Show you care about problems
    - Neutral reviews: Opportunity to connect
    - Other customers see you're responsive

    **How to manage:**

    - Set aside 15-30 minutes daily
    - Reply to yesterday's reviews
    - Use templates for common types
    - Keep replies brief (2-4 sentences)

    **What if you get 100+ reviews per week?**

    - Reply to all negative reviews (priority)
    - Reply to detailed positive reviews (selective)
    - Thank reviews with photos (selective)
    - Consider hiring customer service help

    <Tip>
      **80/20 rule:** If you can't reply to all reviews, prioritize negatives (handle complaints) and photo reviews (reward effort). This covers 80% of the value with 20% of the work.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personalize Every Reply" icon="user">
    **Never use generic templates verbatim**

    **What to personalize:**

    - Use customer's name
    - Reference specific product
    - Mention something from their review
    - Acknowledge their specific concern or praise

    **Template vs Personal:**

    ❌ **Generic template:** "Thank you for your review! We appreciate your feedback. Come back soon!"

    ✅ **Personalized reply:** "Hi Sarah! So glad the blue floral dress fit perfectly for your sister's wedding! Thanks for the photo - you look amazing. We hope to see you back for summer collection!"

    **Why it matters:**

    - Shows you actually read their review
    - Builds real connection
    - Demonstrates authenticity
    - Encourages repeat business

    <Info>
      **Save time with templates:** Create reply templates for common scenarios (positive, negative, neutral), but ALWAYS customize with customer's name and specific details from their review.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle Negative Reviews with Care" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Your reply is public - others are watching**

    **The golden formula for negative reviews:**

    1. **Thank them** - "Thank you for bringing this to our attention"
    2. **Apologize** - "We're sorry you had this experience"
    3. **Take responsibility** - Don't make excuses or blame customer
    4. **Offer solution** - "We'd like to make this right..."
    5. **Take offline if needed** - "Please email us at..."

    **Example negative review reply:**

    ```
    Hi John,
    
    Thank you for your honest feedback about the shipping delay. We sincerely apologize - that's definitely not the experience we want you to have.
    
    I see your order was delayed due to our carrier issues. I've just sent you an email with a refund for the shipping cost and a 20% discount on your next order.
    
    We'd love the chance to earn back your trust. Please reach out to support@store.com if there's anything else we can do.
    
    - Sarah
    ```

    **What NOT to do:**

    - ❌ Argue or defend yourself
    - ❌ Blame the customer
    - ❌ Ignore or delete the review
    - ❌ Ask them to remove/change review in exchange for refund
    - ❌ Be defensive or sarcastic

    <Warning>
      **Never delete honest negative reviews:** It damages trust. Reply professionally instead - it shows other customers you handle problems well.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reply Timing Strategy" icon="calendar">
    **When to write your replies:**

    **Best practice schedule:**

    - Check reviews once daily (morning or evening)
    - Reply to all new reviews from yesterday
    - Negative reviews: Reply within 24 hours (priority)
    - Positive reviews: Reply within 48 hours (still good)

    **Why batch replies:**

    - More efficient than replying one-by-one
    - Maintains consistent tone/quality
    - Less mental context-switching
    - Easier to spot patterns/trends

    **Urgency levels:**

    | Review Type       | Reply Speed     | Why                               |
    | ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
    | 1-2 star negative | Within 24 hours | Damage control, show you care     |
    | 3 star neutral    | Within 48 hours | Opportunity to improve experience |
    | 4-5 star positive | Within 72 hours | Thank them, build relationship    |
    | Photo reviews     | Within 48 hours | Reward the extra effort           |

    <Tip>
      **Set calendar reminder:** Block 15-30 minutes daily for "review replies" - makes it a habit instead of forgotten task.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do customers actually read reply notifications?" icon="envelope-open">
    **Yes, at much higher rates than other emails**

    **Open rates:**

    - Average promotional email: 15-20% open rate
    - Review reply notification: 40-60% open rate
    - Negative review replies: 60-80% open rate

    **Why such high engagement:**

    - Personal to them (about THEIR review)
    - Unexpected (most stores don't reply)
    - Curiosity (what did they say?)
    - Investment (they already took time to review)

    **What they do after opening:**

    - 50-70% click through to view full reply on site
    - 20-30% browse other products while there
    - 10-15% make another purchase within 30 days
    - Many update their review or leave more detailed feedback

    <Info>
      **High ROI activity:** Replying to reviews (and notifying customers) has one of the highest customer retention ROIs - costs almost nothing, builds loyalty significantly.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I reply to positive reviews or just negatives?" icon="question">
    **BOTH - but with different approaches**

    **Positive reviews (4-5 stars):**

    **Why reply:**

    - Thank them publicly
    - Reinforce positive behavior
    - Show other customers you're engaged
    - Build loyalty for repeat purchases

    **How to reply:**

    - Brief thank you (2-3 sentences)
    - Personalize with their name
    - Reference specific product or detail
    - Invite them back

    **Example:** "Thanks Sarah! So happy you love the blue dress. Your photo looks amazing! Come back for our summer collection 😊"

    ---

    **Negative reviews (1-3 stars):**

    **Why reply:**

    - Damage control (show others you care)
    - Opportunity to fix problem
    - Prevent customer churn
    - Demonstrate professionalism

    **How to reply:**

    - Longer, more detailed (4-6 sentences)
    - Apologize sincerely
    - Offer concrete solution
    - Take conversation offline if complex

    **Example:** "Hi John, we sincerely apologize for the sizing issue. I've emailed you directly to arrange a free return and sent a discount for your next order. We'd love to make this right..."

    <Tip>
      **Priority:** If short on time, reply to ALL negatives and SOME positives. Negatives have higher business impact, but positives build relationships.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I include an incentive in my reply?" icon="gift">
    **Depends on the review type**

    **Negative reviews (1-3 stars):**

    **Yes, offer compensation:**

    - Shows you take responsibility
    - Gives customer reason to try again
    - Public gesture of goodwill
    - Often results in review update

    **Example:** "We've sent you 20% off your next order and refunded shipping. We'd love to earn back your trust."

    **Typical compensation:** 15-25% off, free shipping, or store credit

    ---

    **Positive reviews (4-5 stars):**

    **Usually no - but can be strategic:**

    **Don't offer incentive if:**

    - Just saying thank you (no incentive needed)
    - Standard positive review
    - Already rewarded for photo review

    **Do offer incentive if:**

    - Exceptional review (detailed, photos, videos)
    - Influential reviewer (large following)
    - Want to encourage repeat purchase
    - Customer went above and beyond

    **Example:** "Your detailed review with photos is amazing! As a thank-you, here's 10% off your next order..."

    **Typical reward:** 10-15% off

    <Warning>
      **Don't incentivize all positive reviews:** This trains customers to expect discounts for reviews, which is expensive and potentially violates platform policies.
    </Warning>

## Need Help?

<NeedHelp />

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Replying to reviews (especially negative ones) publicly shows potential customers that you care about feedback and handle problems professionally. This builds more trust than having only 5-star reviews with no replies.
