## Reward Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Discount Type: Choose Your Reward" defaultOpen icon="gift">
    ![Vvv](/images/vvv.png)

    **What this setting does: **

    Controls the type of reward customers receive after submitting a photo review.

    Navigation: Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Emails → Photo Review Reward Email → Edit → Settings**

    Available options:

    - **Percentage** – A percentage discount on the next order
    - **Fixed Amount** – A flat discount value (for example, ₹200 or \$10 off)
    - **Free Shipping** – Free shipping on the next order

    <Tip>
      **Most effective:** 10% off next order is the sweet spot - generous enough to motivate, small enough to be profitable
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Discount Value: How Much to Offer" icon="percent">
    **Setting:** Discount Value (for percentage or amount discounts)

    **Finding the right amount:**

    | Discount  | Motivation Level | When to Use                          |
    | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
    | 5% off    | Low              | Established stores with many reviews |
    | 10% off   | Good             | Sweet spot for most stores           |
    | 15% off   | High             | New stores building review base      |
    | 20%+ off  | Very High        | Rarely needed, cuts into margins     |
    | \$5 off   | Medium           | Products under \$50                  |
    | \$10 off  | High             | Products \$50-100                    |
    | \$15+ off | Very High        | Expensive products \$100+            |

    **General guidelines:**

    - **New store:** Start with 15% to build momentum
    - **Established store:** 10% is plenty
    - **High-margin products:** Can afford 15-20%
    - **Low-margin products:** Stick to 10% or free shipping

    <Warning>
      **Don't go too high:** 25%+ discounts train customers to only buy with coupons. You'll lose money long-term.
