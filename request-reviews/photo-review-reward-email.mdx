## Reward Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Discount Type: Choose Your Reward" icon="gift" defaultOpen>
    **Three reward options:**

    ### 1. Percentage Discount (Most Popular)
    **Example:** 10% off next order

    **Pros:**
    - Simple to understand
    - Works for any order size
    - Perceived as generous
    - Easy to communicate

    **Best for:** Most stores

    **Typical amount:** 10-15%

    ---

    ### 2. Fixed Amount Discount
    **Example:** $5 or $10 off next order

    **Pros:**
    - Clear, specific value
    - Good for lower-priced products
    - Customers know exact savings
    - Easy to budget

    **Best for:** Stores with lower average order values ($30-50)

    **Typical amount:** $5-$10

    ---

    ### 3. Free Shipping
    **Example:** Free shipping on next order

    **Pros:**
    - No discount on products (protects margins)
    - Highly valued by customers
    - Simple to fulfill
    - Works with existing shipping setup

    **Best for:** Stores with $5-10 shipping costs

    **Note:** Only valuable if you normally charge for shipping

    <Tip>
    **Most effective:** 10% off next order is the sweet spot - generous enough to motivate, small enough to be profitable.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Discount Value: How Much to Offer" icon="percent">
    **Setting:** Discount Value (for percentage or amount discounts)

    **Finding the right amount:**

    | Discount | Motivation Level | When to Use |
    |----------|-----------------|-------------|
    | 5% off | Low | Established stores with many reviews |
    | 10% off | Good | Sweet spot for most stores |
    | 15% off | High | New stores building review base |
    | 20%+ off | Very High | Rarely needed, cuts into margins |
    | $5 off | Medium | Products under $50 |
    | $10 off | High | Products $50-100 |
    | $15+ off | Very High | Expensive products $100+ |

    **General guidelines:**
    - **New store:** Start with 15% to build momentum
    - **Established store:** 10% is plenty
    - **High-margin products:** Can afford 15-20%
    - **Low-margin products:** Stick to 10% or free shipping

    <Warning>
    **Don't go too high:** 25%+ discounts train customers to only buy with coupons. You'll lose money long-term.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Email Content: Show Appreciation" icon="heart">
    **Setting:** Email Editor (Title, Message, Footer)

    **What makes a good thank-you email:**

    **Tone:**
    - Genuinely grateful (not fake corporate)
    - Excited about the photo
    - Personal and warm
    - Not overly promotional

    **Example structure:**
    ```
    Subject: Thanks for the awesome photo! 🎁

    Hi {{review_author_name}},

    We just saw your review with photos - thank you so much for sharing!

    Your photos help other customers see how [Product] looks in real life. That's incredibly valuable.

    As a thank-you, here's {{YOUR_REWARD:COUPON:VALUE}} off your next order:

    Code: {{YOUR_REWARD:COUPON:CODE}}
    Expires: {{YOUR_REWARD:COUPON:EXPIRY}}

    [Shop Now Button]

    Thanks again for being an amazing customer!

    [Your Name]
    [Store Name]
    ```

    **What to include:**
    - Specific mention of "photos" (not just "review")
    - Why photos matter
    - Clear reward details (code, amount, expiry)
    - Easy redemption (shop now button)
    - Genuine gratitude

    <Tip>
    **Personal touch:** Mention the specific product they reviewed to show you're paying attention: "Thanks for the photos of the [Product Name]!"
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Timing: When to Send" icon="clock">
    **Setting:** Timing (instant vs delayed)

    **Two options:**

    ### Instant (Recommended)
    **Sends:** Within 1-5 minutes of photo submission

    **Pros:**
    - Immediate gratification
    - Customer still thinking about their review
    - Reinforces positive behavior instantly
    - Higher reward redemption rate

    **Best for:** Most stores

    ---

    ### Delayed
    **Sends:** Hours or days later

    **Pros:**
    - Can batch with other communications
    - Gives time to moderate review first

    **Cons:**
    - Less impactful
    - Customer may forget they submitted photos
    - Lower emotional connection

    **Best for:** Stores that manually approve all reviews

    <Info>
    **Psychology tip:** Instant rewards create stronger behavioral reinforcement. Customers associate "photo = immediate reward" and are more likely to add photos in future orders.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set Expiration Dates" icon="calendar-xmark">
    **Always expire reward codes**

    **Recommended expiry:**
    - 30 days: Good balance (most common)
    - 60 days: Generous, but risk of forgetting
    - 90 days: Too long, customers lose urgency
    - 14 days: Too short, feels pressured

    **Why expiration matters:**
    - Creates urgency to return and shop
    - Prevents old codes from lingering
    - Encourages repeat purchases sooner
    - Easier to manage/track

    <Tip>
    **Sweet spot:** 30-day expiration. Long enough to not feel pressured, short enough to drive action.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Make Codes Easy to Use" icon="keyboard">
    **Code format tips:**

    ✅ **Good codes:**
    - PHOTO10 (simple, clear)
    - THANKS10 (explains why)
    - REVIEW15 (easy to remember)

    ❌ **Bad codes:**
    - XR2K9-P4L7Q-9WMZ (too complex)
    - photo_review_discount_2024 (too long)
    - phot0rev1ew (confusing with numbers/letters)

    **Best practices:**
    - 6-10 characters maximum
    - All caps or all lowercase (not mixed)
    - No special characters
    - Easy to type on mobile
    - Memorable

    <Info>
    **Auto-apply option:** Even better - provide link that auto-applies the code at checkout. No typing needed!
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prevent Abuse" icon="shield">
    **Protect against gaming the system:**

    **Set these limits:**
    - One reward per customer per order
    - Can't combine with other discounts
    - Minimum order value (optional)
    - Single-use codes (no sharing)

    **Watch for:**
    - Same customer submitting multiple photo reviews to farm codes
    - Low-effort photos (blurry, poor quality)
    - Photos that don't match product

    **Solutions:**
    - Review photos before auto-sending rewards (if you're concerned)
    - Set minimum review text length (prevents spam reviews)
    - Limit to one photo reward per customer per month

    <Warning>
    **Moderate if needed:** If you see customers abusing the system (uploading random photos just for rewards), switch to manual reward approval.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Reward Redemption" icon="clipboard-check">
    **Make sure customers can actually use the reward:**

    **Test checklist:**
    1. Send yourself a test reward email
    2. Copy the code
    3. Go to your store
    4. Add item to cart
    5. Apply code at checkout
    6. Verify discount appears correctly
    7. Complete test order (or cancel)

    **Common issues:**
    - Code doesn't apply (check WooCommerce coupon settings)
    - Discount amount wrong (verify coupon value)
    - Code expired immediately (check expiry date formula)
    - Code already used (make sure test codes are single-use)

    <Tip>
    **Test regularly:** Test photo reward flow every few weeks to catch any issues before customers experience them.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much do photo rewards actually cost?" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Let's do the math:**

    **Assumptions:**
    - 100 orders/month
    - 10% review rate = 10 reviews
    - 40% include photos with reward = 4 photo reviews
    - 10% discount reward
    - $60 average order value for reward redemption

    **Cost calculation:**
    - 4 customers get 10% off $60 = $6 discount each
    - **Total cost: $24/month**
    - **You get:** 4 valuable photo reviews

    **ROI:**
    - Photo reviews increase conversion by 20%
    - Even small conversion boost pays for rewards many times over
    - Plus increased customer lifetime value from return visits

    **Bottom line:** Photo rewards typically pay for themselves 5-10x over.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I reward ALL reviews or just photo reviews?" icon="camera-vs-text">
    **Our strong recommendation: Photo reviews only**

    **Why photos only:**
    - Photos provide more value (visual proof)
    - Higher reward = higher quality (customers put in effort)
    - Prevents reward farming (text review spam)
    - Focuses rewards on high-value content

    **Text review rewards:**
    - Lower incentive (5% vs 10% for photos)
    - Or no reward (just ask nicely)
    - Reserve big rewards for photo reviews

    **Example strategy:**
    - Text review: Thank you email (no reward)
    - Photo review: 10% off reward
    - Video review: 15% off reward (if you accept videos)

    <Tip>
    **Tiered rewards work:** Customers understand that more effort (photos) = better reward. This feels fair and motivates quality submissions.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if someone submits a bad photo just for the reward?" icon="image-slash">
    **This happens occasionally:**

    **Examples of "reward farming":**
    - Blurry, unclear photos
    - Photos of packaging only (not product)
    - Random unrelated images
    - Stock photos (stolen from internet)

    **How to handle:**

    **Option 1: Manual approval**
    - Review photos before sending rewards
    - Only reward quality photos
    - Reject spam photos
    - More work, but more control

    **Option 2: Post-review moderation**
    - Auto-send rewards immediately
    - Check photos periodically
    - Reject/hide poor photos after the fact
    - Customer keeps reward (easier than taking it back)

    **Option 3: Set expectations**
    - Email message: "Clear photos that show the product"
    - Review form: Minimum photo quality guidelines
    - Examples of good vs bad photos

    **Reality check:** 95% of customers submit genuine photos. Don't overthink this - a few bad apples aren't worth complicating the system for everyone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can customers use reward immediately on same order?" icon="question">
    **No, and that's intentional**

    **Why rewards are for NEXT order:**
    - Encourages repeat purchases
    - Increases customer lifetime value
    - Brings customers back to your store
    - Creates ongoing relationship

    **What customers expect:**
    - They understand "next order" means future purchase
    - Standard practice across e-commerce
    - Fair trade for leaving photo review

    **Make it clear:**
    - Subject line: "For your NEXT order"
    - Email body: "Use on your next purchase"
    - Expiry date: "Valid for 30 days"

    <Info>
    **The goal:** Photo reward isn't just "payment" for review - it's an excuse to get customers to come back and shop again.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if customer adds photo AFTER initial review?" icon="clock-plus">
    **Yuko handles this automatically:**

    **Scenario 1: Photo added later**
    - Customer submits text review (no photo)
    - Days/weeks later, adds photo to their review
    - **Yuko detects photo addition**
    - **Sends reward email automatically**

    **Scenario 2: Multiple photos**
    - Customer adds one photo (gets reward)
    - Later adds more photos
    - **No additional reward** (one reward per review)

    **Scenario 3: Multiple products reviewed**
    - Customer orders 3 products
    - Reviews all 3 with photos
    - **Gets one reward email** (not three separate emails)
    - All photos mentioned in thank-you

    <Tip>
    **This is good:** Customers can submit text review quickly, then add photos when they have more time. You still get photos and they still get rewarded.
    </Tip>

## Need Help?

<Snippet file="need-help" />

<Note>
**Pro tip:** Photo rewards have the highest ROI of any review feature. Stores see 2-3x more photo reviews with rewards, and those photos increase conversion rates by 20%. This feature pays for itself many times over.
