## Turn 15-25% of Text Reviews into Photo Reviews

Customers who already took the time to write a review are much more likely to add photos when asked. A gentle reminder 3-7 days after their text review can convert 15-25% into valuable photo reviews without being pushy.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Convert text reviews into photo reviews
- Increase visual social proof by 30-50%
- Build more authentic-looking review sections
- Boost product page conversions with real customer images

<Info>
  **Impact:** 15-25% of text reviewers add photos when reminded | **Time to set up:** 5 minutes

## How It Works

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Emails → Photo Review Reminder Email**

![Prnew 1](/images/prnew-1.png)

**The Automatic Process**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Submits Text Review" icon="pen">
    Customer writes a helpful review but doesn't include any photos.

    **Why they skip photos:** Too busy, on mobile, didn't think it was important, forgot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yuko Detects Text-Only Review" icon="eye">
    Yuko automatically detects that the review was submitted without photos.

    **Smart tracking:** Only text-only reviews trigger this email (customers who already added photos won't get reminded).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reminder Waits" icon="clock">
    Yuko waits your set delay (default: 5 days after review submission without photo).

    **Why wait:** Gives customer time to receive and use product more, increasing chance they'll have photos ready.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Photo Reminder Sends" icon="camera">
    Customer receives friendly email thanking them for the review and asking if they'd like to add photos.

    **Tone:** Appreciative and optional, never demanding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Adds Photos (or Doesn't)" icon="image">
    Customer clicks link, uploads photos to their existing review.

    **Success rate:** 15-25% of reminded customers add photos.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many customers actually add photos when reminded?" icon="chart-line">
    **Expected response rates:**

    **Without reminder:**

    - 10-15% of reviews include photos naturally
    - 85-90% are text-only

    **With polite reminder (no incentive):**

    - 15-20% of text-only reviewers add photos when asked
    - Total photo rate increases to 25-30%

    **With reminder + small incentive (\$3-5 credit):**

    - 20-25% of text-only reviewers add photos
    - Total photo rate increases to 30-35%

    **Math example:**

    - 100 reviews collected
    - 15 naturally include photos (15%)
    - 85 are text-only
    - Send reminder to 85 text-only reviewers
    - 17 add photos (20% response rate)
    - **New total: 32 photo reviews (32%) instead of 15 (15%)**

    <Info>
      **Impact:** Photo reminder can double your photo review count with minimal effort.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I use Photo Reward OR Photo Reminder (or both)?" icon="question">
    **Understanding the difference:**

    **Photo Review Reward Email:**

    - Sends when customer submits review WITH photos
    - Thanks them and offers reward (10% off)
    - Encourages future customers to include photos upfront

    **Photo Review Reminder Email:**

    - Sends when customer submits review WITHOUT photos
    - Asks them to add photos to existing review
    - Converts text reviews into photo reviews

    **Can you use both? Yes!**

    **Recommended strategy:**

    1. Enable Photo Reward Email with 10% off (encourages upfront photos)
    2. Enable Photo Reminder Email with NO incentive or smaller incentive (5% off or \$3 credit)
    3. Customers who submit photos initially get better reward
    4. Customers who submit text-only get gentle reminder

    **Why this works:**

    - Incentivizes photos upfront (better)
    - Still captures photos from text-only reviewers
    - Doesn't train customers to skip photos and wait for reminder
    - Fair tiered approach (more effort = better reward)

    <Tip>
      **Keep reward smaller:** If Photo Reward gives 10% off, Photo Reminder should give 5% off or less. Otherwise customers learn to skip photos initially.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if customer doesn't have photos?" icon="camera-slash">
    **Don't worry - this is normal and okay**

    **Common reasons customers don't have photos:**

    - Product not photogenic (consumables, digital products)
    - Customer privacy concerns
    - Genuinely too busy
    - Already disposed of product
    - Neutral experience (works fine, nothing special to show)

    **How to handle:**

    - Send ONE polite reminder
    - Make it clear photos are optional
    - Thank them for written review regardless
    - If they don't respond, accept it and move on
    - Never send second reminder

    **What NOT to do:**

    - Don't make photos mandatory
    - Don't penalize text-only reviews
    - Don't remove/hide text reviews without photos
    - Don't keep asking repeatedly

    **Reality check:** Even with reminders and incentives, 70-75% of reviews will remain text-only. That's normal and acceptable.

    <Warning>
      **Text reviews are valuable too:** Don't dismiss or devalue text-only reviews. They still build trust and help customers make decisions.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** If you use Photo Review Reward Email (for reviews submitted with photos), keep this Photo Reminder incentive smaller or skip it entirely. You want to encourage photos upfront, not train customers to wait for the reminder.
