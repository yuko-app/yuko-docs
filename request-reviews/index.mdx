## Get More Customer Reviews with Automated Emails

Instead of manually asking for reviews, Yuko automatically sends review request emails to customers after they receive their orders. This increases your review collection rate by 10x compared to hoping customers review on their own.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Automatically ask every customer for a review
- Send reminders to customers who don't respond
- Collect more photo reviews with rewards
- Build trust and increase sales with authentic feedback

<Info>
  **Average results:** Stores collect reviews from 5-10% of customers with basic requests, 15-25% with reminders and rewards

## How Review Request Emails Work

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Emails**

![Yuko6 Pn](/images/yuko6.png)

### The Automatic Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Receives Their Order" icon="box">
    When you mark an order as "Completed" in WooCommerce, Yuko knows the customer received their purchase.

    **Your action:** Mark orders as Completed when they're delivered (you probably already do this)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yuko Waits for the Right Time" icon="clock">
    Yuko automatically waits your set number of days before sending the review request.

    **Default timing:** 7 days after delivery **Why wait?** Customers need time to use the product before they can write a helpful review
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Request Email Sends" icon="envelope">
    Customer receives a personalized email with a link to review their purchase.

    **What's included:**

    - Customer's name (personalized greeting)
    - Products they ordered
    - One-click link to review form
    - Optional discount reward for reviewing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Writes Review (or Doesn't)" icon="pen">
    If customer writes a review, great! If they don't respond, Yuko can send a reminder.

    **Response rate:** 5-10% of customers review after first email
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reminder Email Sends (Optional)" icon="bell">
    3-5 days later, customers who didn't respond receive a gentle reminder.

    **Additional response rate:** +50% more reviews with reminder emails
  </Step>
  <Step title="Photo Requests & Rewards (Optional)" icon="camera">
    Encourage customers who already reviewed to add photos, or reward them for photo reviews.

    **Impact:** Photos increase trust and boost conversion rates by 20%
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many emails should I send?" icon="question">
    **Recommended approach:**

    **Minimum (every store should do this):**

    - Review Request Email

    **Recommended (for better results):**

    - Review Request Email
    - Review Reminder Email (one reminder only)

    **Maximum (without annoying customers):**

    - Review Request
    - Review Reminder (once)
    - Photo Reminder or Reward (one of these, not both)

    **Don't:** Send more than 3 emails total about the same order. Customers will unsubscribe or mark as spam.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's a good response rate?" icon="chart-line">
    **Industry benchmarks:**

    - **No review requests:** less than 1% of customers review on their own
    - **Basic review request:** 5-10% response rate
    - **Request + reminder:** 10-15% response rate
    - **Request + reminder + incentive:** 15-25% response rate

    **Your results depend on:**

    - Product quality (better products = more reviews)
    - Customer satisfaction (happy customers review more)
    - Email timing (right timing = higher response)
    - Incentive amount (bigger reward = more responses)

    <Info>
      **Don't worry if your rate is lower than 10%** - this is still 10x better than not asking at all!
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I offer rewards for reviews?" icon="gift">
    **Pros of offering rewards:**

    - 2-3x higher response rate
    - More detailed reviews (customers put in effort)
    - Faster review collection
    - Customers appreciate the gesture

    **Cons of offering rewards:**

    - Costs you money (discount or credit)
    - May attract reviews only from deal-seekers
    - Some platforms prohibit incentivized reviews

    **Best practice:**

    - Offer small reward for **photo reviews only** (10% off)
    - Don't offer reward for just any review
    - Make sure reward doesn't influence rating (don't say "leave 5 stars for discount")

    <Warning>
      **Important:** Never ask for positive reviews only. Ask for honest feedback. Offering rewards for 5-star reviews violates most platform policies.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When should I send review requests?" icon="clock">
    **General rule:** Wait until customer has used the product

    **Product-specific timing:**

    | Product Type       | Recommended Delay | Why                      |
    | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
    | Clothing/Fashion   | 5-7 days          | Time to wear and wash    |
    | Electronics        | 10-14 days        | Time to unbox and use    |
    | Supplements/Health | 21-30 days        | Time to see results      |
    | Books/Digital      | 3-5 days          | Quick consumption        |
    | Home Goods         | 7-10 days         | Time to set up and use   |
    | Food/Perishables   | 3-5 days          | Quick consumption        |
    | Cosmetics          | 7-14 days         | Time to test product     |
    | Furniture          | 10-14 days        | Time to assemble and use |

    **Pro tip:** You can set different delays for different products using Advanced Workflows
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if customers ignore my review requests?" icon="envelope-open">
    **Don't take it personally** - most customers don't respond to review requests.

    **Why customers don't review:**

    - Too busy (most common reason - 70%)
    - Forgot about the email (15%)
    - Don't know what to say (10%)
    - Had neutral experience (not good or bad enough to review) (5%)

    **How to improve response:**

    1. **Better timing:** Send when experience is fresh
    2. **Make it easy:** One-click to review form, pre-fill details
    3. **Add incentive:** Small reward for their time
    4. **Send reminder:** One gentle follow-up (don't spam)
    5. **Perfect the email:** Test different subject lines and messages

    **Accept that:** Even the best stores only get 20-25% response rate maximum
