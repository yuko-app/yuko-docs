## Ask Every Customer for a Review Automatically

The Review Request Email is your primary tool for collecting customer feedback. Instead of hoping customers review on their own (only 1% do), this email automatically asks them after delivery, increasing review collection by 10x.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Automatically request reviews from every customer
- Collect reviews from 5-10% of customers (vs less than 1% without asking)
- Personalize emails with customer names and products
- Control timing to match your product type

<Info>
  **Time to set up:** 10 minutes | **Expected response rate:** 5-10% of customers
</Info>

## How It Works

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Emails → Review Request Email**

![Rrnew](/images/rrnew.png)

### The Automatic Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Order Completed" icon="circle-check">
    You mark an order as "Completed" in WooCommerce (when customer receives it).

    **This triggers the countdown** to send the review request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yuko Waits" icon="clock">
    Yuko waits the number of days you set.

    **Why wait?** Customers need time to use the product before reviewing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Email Sends Automatically" icon="paper-plane">
    Customer receives personalized email with:

    - Their name
    - Products they ordered
    - One-click link to review form
    - Optional discount reward

    **No manual work needed** - happens automatically for every order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Clicks & Reviews" icon="pen-to-square">
    Customer clicks button, lands on a review form, rates the product and writes review.

    **Success rate:** 5-10% of customers complete the review.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Email Settings

Configure your review request email to match your products and brand:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Timing: When to Send" defaultOpen icon="calendar">
    **Setting:** Delay - Days after order fulfillment

    ![Set Re](/images/setre.png)

    **What it controls :** Set the number of days YUKO should wait **after an order is fulfilled** before sending the review request email.

    This delay allows customers time to receive and use their products, helping them leave more meaningful and accurate reviews.

    **How to choose the right timing:**

    | Product Type       | Recommended Delay | Reason                         |
    | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
    | Clothing/Fashion   | 5-7 days          | Time to wear and wash          |
    | Electronics        | 10-14 days        | Time to unbox, set up, and use |
    | Supplements/Health | 21-30 days        | Time to see results            |
    | Books/Digital      | 3-5 days          | Quick to consume               |
    | Home Goods         | 7-10 days         | Time to set up and use         |
    | Food/Perishables   | 3-5 days          | Quick consumption              |
    | Furniture          | 10-14 days        | Time to assemble and use       |

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Don't send too soon. If you ask before customers use the product, they can't write a helpful review. Better to wait a bit longer than send too early.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Subject Line: First Impression" icon="envelope">
    **Setting:** Email Subject

    **What it means:** The title customers see in their inbox before opening

    **Best practices:**

    ✅ **Good subject lines:**

    - How’s your order_name?
    - customer_first_name, share your thoughts on your order
    - Quick question about your recent order
    - We’d love your feedback on order_name

    ### ❌ **Avoid:**

    - "WRITE A REVIEW NOW" (too pushy)
    - "Please leave us a 5-star review" (biased)
    - Long subjects over 60 characters (get cut off on mobile)
    - Generic "Review Request" (not personalized)

    **Personalization tip:** Use `{{customer_first_name}}` in subject to increase open rates by 2x

    <Info>
      **Mobile matters:** 60% of emails are opened on phones. Keep subject lines under 50 characters so they don't get cut off.
    </Info>

## Available Shortcodes (Personalization Tags)

Make your emails personal by inserting customer and order information:

### Customer Information

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Customer Name">
    **Use these to personalize greetings:**

    - `{{customer_name}}` - Full name (John Smith)
    - `{{customer_first_name}}` - First name only (John)
    - `{{customer_last_name}}` - Last name only (Smith)

    **Example:**

    ```
    Hi {{customer_first_name}},
    ```

    **Result:** "Hi John,"

    <Tip>
      Using first name in subject line or greeting increases open rates by 26% and response rates by 18%.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Order Details">
    **Reference their specific order:**

    - `{{order_id}}` - Order number (12345)
    - `{{order_name}}` - Order reference (#WC-12345)

    **Example:**

    ```
    Thank you for order {{order_name}}!
    ```

    **Result:** "Thank you for order #WC-12345!"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Product Display">
    **Show the products they bought:**

    **For all products in order:**

    ```
    {{product_reviews_block}}
    ```

    This displays a formatted block with all products, images, and review buttons.

    **Loop through products individually:**

    ```
    {% for item in order_items %}
      {{item.review_block}}
    {% endfor %}
    ```

    This displays each product separately with its own review button.

    <Info>
      **What customers see:** Product images, names, and a "Review this product" button for each item. Makes it easy to review multiple products.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Rewards/Coupons">
    **If offering a discount for reviewing:**

    - `{{YOUR_IDENTIFIER:COUPON:CODE}}` - The coupon code
    - `{{YOUR_IDENTIFIER:COUPON:TYPE}}` - Type (percentage, amount, free shipping)
    - `{{YOUR_IDENTIFIER:COUPON:VALUE}}` - Value (10%, \$5, etc.)
    - `{{YOUR_IDENTIFIER:COUPON:EXPIRY}}` - Expiration date

    **Example:**

    ```
    Use code {{REVIEW10:COUPON:CODE}} for {{REVIEW10:COUPON:VALUE}} off your next order!
    ```

    **Result:** "Use code REVIEW10 for 10% off your next order!"

    <Warning>
      **Important:** If offering rewards, offer for completing the review, NOT for leaving a 5-star review. Incentivizing positive reviews is against most platform policies.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's a good response rate?" icon="chart-line">
    **Industry benchmarks for review request emails:**

    - **5-7%** = Good (average response rate)
    - **8-12%** = Great (above average)
    - **13-15%** = Excellent (top performers)
    - **Below 3%** = Needs improvement

    **Factors that affect your rate:**

    - **Product quality** - Better products = more reviews
    - **Customer satisfaction** - Happy customers review more
    - **Email timing** - Right timing = better response
    - **Email design** - Professional = higher trust
    - **Subject line** - Personal = higher opens
    - **Incentive** - Rewards = 2x response rate

    <Info>
      **Starting out?** First month may be lower (3-5%) as customers get used to emails. Give it time to improve.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I offer a discount for reviewing?" icon="gift">
    **Pros:**

    - 2-3x higher response rate (5% → 10-15%)
    - More detailed reviews (customers put in effort)
    - Faster review collection
    - Increased customer loyalty

    **Cons:**

    - Costs you money (10% discount per review)
    - May attract only bargain hunters
    - Some reviews may feel "bought"
    - Violates policies if you ask for positive reviews only

    **Our recommendation:**

    - **New stores:** Offer incentive to build review base quickly
    - **Established stores:** Use incentive only for photo reviews
    - **Always:** Offer for honest feedback, not just 5 stars

    **Typical incentives:**

    - 10% off next order (most common)
    - $5-$10 store credit
    - Free shipping on next purchase
    - Entry into monthly \$100 giveaway
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I send to all past customers?" icon="users">
    **Should you email old customers?**

    **Best practice:**

    - **Recent customers (last 30-60 days):** Yes, send review requests
    - **Older customers (60-90 days):** Maybe, if they haven't reviewed
    - **Very old (90+ days):** No, they won't remember the product

    **How to do it:**

    1. Go to Yuko Dashboard → Customers
    2. Filter by "No review" and "Last 60 days"
    3. Send one-time review request (manual send)

    **Don't:**

    - Email customers from 6 months ago
    - Spam customers who already reviewed
    - Send multiple requests for same order

    <Warning>
      **Risk:** Emailing very old customers may result in spam complaints. Stick to recent orders (under 90 days).
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I sell multiple products per order?" icon="boxes">
    **Two approaches:**

    **Option 1: Single email with all products** (recommended)

    - Send one email listing all products
    - Customer can review one, some, or all
    - Less email clutter for customer
    - Use `{{product_reviews_block}}` shortcode

    **Option 2: Separate email per product**

    - Send individual emails for each product
    - Good for very different product types
    - Risk of annoying customers with too many emails

    **Our recommendation:** Use single email with product review block. Customers appreciate less inbox clutter.

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** If order has 5+ products, consider asking for one "overall order review" instead of per-product reviews. Customers won't review 10 items individually.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I test my email before sending?" icon="flask">
    **Always test before enabling:**

    **Steps to test:**

    1. In Review Request Email settings, scroll to bottom
    2. Click "Send Test Email"
    3. Enter your email address
    4. Click Send
    5. Check your inbox (and spam folder)
    6. Open on phone AND computer
    7. Click all links to make sure they work

    **What to check:**

    - Subject line looks good
    - Your name appears in greeting (personalization works)
    - Products display correctly
    - Review button works
    - Mobile version looks professional
    - Images load quickly
    - No typos or broken links

    <Tip>
      **Test on multiple devices:** Check on iPhone, Android, desktop email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail). They all display differently.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I A/B test different email versions?" icon="flask-vial">
    **Yes, but do it manually:**

    Yuko doesn't have built-in A/B testing yet, but you can test yourself:

    **Simple testing approach:**

    1. **Week 1:** Use Subject Line A
    2. **Week 2:** Use Subject Line B
    3. **Compare:** Which had better response rate?
    4. **Keep winner**, test something else

    **What to test:**

    - Subject lines (biggest impact)
    - Email length (short vs detailed)
    - Button text ("Review Now" vs "Share Feedback")
    - Timing (7 days vs 10 days vs 14 days)
    - Incentive amount (10% vs 15% vs \$10)

    **How to measure:**

    - Go to Reviews → Analytics (or count manually)
    - Calculate: (Reviews received ÷ Emails sent) × 100 = Response rate %

    <Info>
      **Pro tip:** Only test one thing at a time. If you change subject AND timing AND incentive, you won't know what worked.

<NeedHelp />

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Start with a 7-day delay for most products. After a month, check your response rate. If it's low ( less than 3%), try increasing the delay (customers may need more time) or adding a small incentive.
