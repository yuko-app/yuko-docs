## Get 50% More Reviews with One Gentle Reminder

Most customers who don't respond to the first review request aren't refusing - they're just busy and forgot. A single friendly reminder sent 3-5 days later can increase your review collection rate by 50% (from 5-10% to 7-15%).

**What you'll achieve:**

- Automatically remind non-responders without manual work
- Increase review collection by +50%
- Stay top-of-mind without being annoying
- Collect feedback from customers who needed a nudge

<Info>
  **Impact:** Adds +50% more reviews | **Time to set up:** 5 minutes

## How It Works

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Emails → Review Reminder Email**

![Rr2new](/images/rr2new.png)

### The Automatic Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Request Sent" icon="paper-plane">
    Customer receives initial review request 5 days after order delivery (or your set delay).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yuko Tracks Response" icon="eye">
    Yuko automatically tracks whether customer clicked the review link or submitted a review.

    **Yuko knows who responded** - only non-responders get the reminder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reminder Waits" icon="clock">
    For customers who didn't respond, Yuko waits your set delay (default: 5 days after first email).

    **No duplicate emails** - customers who already reviewed won't get reminded.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reminder Sends" icon="bell">
    Non-responders receive a gentle, friendly reminder with the same review link.

    **One reminder only** - Yuko won't send multiple reminders (that would be spam).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Reviews" icon="pen-to-square">
    The reminder jogs their memory and they write the review.

    **Additional response rate:** +2-5% of customers respond to reminder.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Email Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Timing: When to Send Reminder" defaultOpen icon="calendar">
    **Setting:** Delay (days)

    **What it means:** How many days after the first review request should the reminder send?

    **Default:** 5 days

    **How to choose:**

    | Delay                | When to Use                                   | Why                                          |
    | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | 3 days               | Fast-moving products (food, consumables)      | Quick reminder while experience is fresh     |
    | 5 days (recommended) | Most products                                 | Good balance - not too soon, not too late    |
    | 7 days               | Considered purchases (electronics, furniture) | Give more time before following up           |
    | 10+ days             | Don't use                                     | Too late - customer forgot about the product |

    <Tip>
      **Sweet spot:** 5 days is proven to work best for most stores. Not pushy, but soon enough that customers remember the product.
    </Tip>
    <Warning>
      **Don't be pushy:** Sending reminder same day or next day after first email feels desperate. Give customers at least 3 days.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Subject Line: Keep it Friendly" icon="envelope">
    **Setting:** Email Subject

    **Best practices for reminder subject lines:**

    ✅ **Good reminder subjects:**

    - "Did you get a chance to review [Product]?"
    - "Quick reminder: Share your thoughts?"
    - "We're still hoping to hear from you, [First Name]"
    - "One more thing about your order..."

    ❌ **Avoid:**

    - "FINAL REMINDER" (sounds threatening)
    - "You forgot to review" (sounds accusatory)
    - Same subject as first email (they'll think it's duplicate)
    - "Last chance" or urgency tactics (not necessary)

    **Key differences from first email:**

    - More casual/friendly tone
    - Acknowledge it's a follow-up
    - No pressure or urgency
    - Shorter and simpler

    <Info>
      **Make it different:** Use a noticeably different subject than your first email so customers don't think it's a duplicate and delete it.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Message: Stay Polite" icon="message">
    **Setting:** Message Body

    **What makes a good reminder email:**

    **Keep it shorter than first email:**

    - 2-3 sentences max
    - Acknowledge this is a follow-up
    - No guilt trips or pressure
    - Super simple ask

    **Example structure:**

    ```
    Hi {{customer_first_name}},
    
    Just following up on our email from a few days ago. If you have 2 minutes, we'd love to hear your thoughts on [Product Name].
    
    Your feedback helps other customers shop with confidence.
    
    [Review Button]
    
    No worries if you're too busy - we understand!
    ```

    **What NOT to write:**

    - ❌ "You haven't reviewed yet" (sounds accusatory)
    - ❌ "This is your last chance" (creates false urgency)
    - ❌ "Please please please review" (sounds desperate)
    - ❌ Long explanations (they already got those in first email)

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Add "No worries if you're too busy" at the end. This reduces pressure and actually increases response rates because customers feel respected.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Footer & Unsubscribe" icon="door-open">
    **Important for reminders:**

    Make it VERY easy to opt out:

    - Clear unsubscribe link
    - "Don't want reminders? Click here" option
    - Respect opt-outs immediately

    **Why this matters:**

    - Legal requirement in most countries
    - Shows respect for customer's time
    - Prevents spam complaints
    - Maintains good sender reputation

    **Your footer auto-fills from:** Settings → Organization (same as review request email)

    <Warning>
      **Spam risk:** Reminder emails have higher spam complaint risk than first emails. Make unsubscribe obvious and easy.
    </Warning>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="One Reminder Only" icon="hand-stop">
    **Don't send multiple reminders**

    - One follow-up is friendly
    - Two is annoying
    - Three is spam

    If customer didn't respond after reminder, let it go. They're not interested or too busy.

    **Yuko automatically:** Sends only ONE reminder per order
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep it Light" icon="smile">
    **Tone matters**

    - Friendly, not formal
    - Casual, not corporate
    - Helpful, not pushy
    - Understanding, not demanding

    **Remember:** You're asking a favor, not demanding action
  </Card>
  <Card title="Make it Easy" icon="mouse-pointer">
    **Remove friction**

    - Same review link as first email (pre-filled form)
    - Big, obvious button
    - Mobile-friendly
    - One click to review

    **Don't:** Make them search for the review form or re-enter information
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test First" icon="flask">
    **Always test**

    Send test to yourself:

    - Check it arrives in inbox (not spam)
    - Tone sounds friendly, not pushy
    - Link works
    - Mobile looks good

    **Adjust if needed** before enabling
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much do reminders actually help?" icon="chart-line">
    **Real impact numbers:**

    **Without reminder:**

    - 5-10% of customers leave reviews after first email
    - Rest never review (too busy, forgot, or not interested)

    **With one reminder:**

    - Original 5-10% still respond to first email
    - Additional 2-5% respond to reminder
    - **Total: 7-15% review rate** (+50% improvement)

    **Why it works:**

    - Most non-responders just forgot
    - Reminder jogs their memory
    - Shows you care about feedback
    - Second chance without being pushy

    <Info>
      **Rule of thumb:** Expect reminder to add 30-50% more reviews on top of your base rate. If 10 people reviewed from first email, expect 3-5 more from reminder.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will customers find reminders annoying?" icon="face-frown">
    **If done right, no:**

    **What makes reminders annoying:**

    - ❌ Sent too soon (next day)
    - ❌ Multiple reminders (2-3 follow-ups)
    - ❌ Pushy or demanding tone
    - ❌ Guilt trips ("You promised to review")
    - ❌ Fake urgency ("Last chance!")

    **What makes reminders acceptable:**

    - ✅ Wait at least 3-5 days
    - ✅ Send only ONE reminder
    - ✅ Friendly, casual tone
    - ✅ Easy unsubscribe
    - ✅ Acknowledge it's optional

    **Industry standard:** One reminder email 3-7 days later is considered normal and acceptable business practice.

    <Tip>
      **Test yourself:** How do you feel when companies send you reminder emails? Copy the ones that feel friendly, avoid the ones that feel pushy.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I offer an incentive in the reminder?" icon="gift">
    **Two approaches:**

    **Option 1: Same incentive as first email** (recommended)

    - If first email offered 10% off for reviewing, reminder mentions same offer
    - Consistent messaging
    - Simple to manage

    **Option 2: Add NEW incentive in reminder**

    - First email: No incentive or small incentive
    - Reminder: Bigger incentive ("Special offer: 15% off if you review now")
    - Can boost reminder response rate
    - Risk: Trains customers to wait for reminder to get better deal

    **Our recommendation:**

    - New stores: Offer same incentive in both emails
    - Established stores: Test adding incentive only in reminder
    - Always: Make sure incentive is for honest feedback, not positive reviews

    <Warning>
      **Don't:** Increase incentive in reminder or customers will learn to ignore first email and wait for the "better offer" in the follow-up.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if customers already reviewed but still get reminder?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **This shouldn't happen, but if it does:**

    **How Yuko prevents this:**

    - Tracks who clicked review link
    - Tracks who submitted reviews
    - Automatically excludes them from reminder list
    - Only true non-responders get reminded

    **If customer complains they already reviewed:**

    1. Apologize ("Sorry, technical glitch!")
    2. Check Yuko dashboard - did their review actually submit?
    3. If yes: Exclude them from future reminders
    4. If no: Their review may not have gone through - help them resubmit

    **This is rare** - Yuko's tracking is very accurate. But technical glitches can happen (email bounces, spam filters, etc.).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I send reminders to old customers who never reviewed?" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Yes, but be careful:**

    **Good candidates for one-time reminder:**

    - Ordered 30-60 days ago
    - Never received review request (you just set up Yuko)
    - Never reviewed

    **Don't send reminder to:**

    - Orders from 90+ days ago (too old, they forgot)
    - Customers who already reviewed
    - Customers who unsubscribed

    **How to do it:**

    1. Go to Yuko Dashboard → Customers
    2. Filter: "No review" + "Last 60 days"
    3. Send one-time manual review request
    4. Wait 5 days, send one-time manual reminder

    <Tip>
      **Label it differently:** For old customers, say "We recently added a review system" so they know why they're hearing from you now.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I personalize reminder differently than first email?" icon="sparkle">
    **Yes, small changes help:**

    **First email tone:**

    - Professional and appreciative
    - "We'd love your feedback"
    - Focus on helping other customers

    **Reminder email tone:**

    - More casual and friendly
    - "Just checking in"
    - Acknowledge they're busy
    - Even more brief

    **Example differences:**

    **First email:** "Thank you for your recent purchase! We'd love to hear about your experience with [Product]. Your review helps other customers make confident decisions."

    **Reminder:** "Hi again! Just a quick follow-up - if you have 2 minutes, we'd love your thoughts on [Product]. No worries if you're too busy!"

    **Key difference:** Reminder is shorter, more casual, and acknowledges the follow-up nature.
