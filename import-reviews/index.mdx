## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will imported reviews affect my SEO?" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Yes - imported reviews maintain SEO value (if done correctly)**

    **SEO benefits of imported reviews:**

    **Preserved content:**

    - Review text is valuable indexed content
    - Keywords in reviews help product page rankings
    - More content = better SEO
    - Google sees review history

    **Rich snippets maintained:**

    - Star ratings show in search results
    - Review count displays
    - Product rating markup
    - Enhanced search listings

    **Fresh + historical content:**

    - Mix of old and new reviews is ideal
    - Shows product history and consistency
    - Recent reviews + established history
    - Better than starting from zero

    **How to maintain SEO value:**

    **1. Preserve review dates**

    - Don't import all as "today"
    - Keep original review dates
    - Shows natural review pattern

    **2. Keep review content intact**

    - Don't edit or paraphrase reviews
    - Maintain original text
    - Preserve keywords customers used

    **3. Implement schema markup**

    - Use Review schema (schema.org)
    - Include AggregateRating markup
    - Yuko handles this automatically

    **4. Don't remove old reviews immediately**

    - Keep both systems running briefly (1-2 weeks)
    - Monitor search rankings
    - Gradual transition vs sudden removal

    **5. Set up redirects if needed**

    - If review URLs changed
    - 301 redirects from old to new
    - Preserve link equity

    **Potential SEO risks:**

    **Risk 1: Duplicate content**

    - Reviews exist on old platform AND Yuko
    - Google sees duplicates
    - Confused about canonical version

    **Solution:** Remove old reviews once Yuko is live

    **Risk 2: Lost review markup**

    - Old system had schema, new doesn't
    - Rich snippets disappear from search
    - Click-through rate drops

    **Solution:** Yuko auto-adds schema markup

    **Risk 3: URL structure changes**

    - Review URLs different in Yuko
    - Indexed review links break
    - 404 errors

    **Solution:** Set up redirects or use same URL structure

    **Monitor SEO during transition:**

    - Google Search Console: Check impressions/clicks
    - Rich results test: Verify markup working
    - Product page rankings: Monitor positions
    - Organic traffic: Watch for drops

    <Tip>
      **Best practice:** Import reviews → verify schema markup → keep old system live for 1 week → remove old reviews → monitor SEO for 2 weeks. This gradual approach minimizes SEO risk.
    </Tip>

    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I import reviews from multiple sources?" icon="layer-group">
    **Yes - combine reviews from different platforms**

    **Common multi-source scenarios:**

    **Scenario 1: Platform migration + previous platform**

    - Migrated from Magento to Shopify to WooCommerce
    - Reviews scattered across all three platforms
    - Want to consolidate everything in Yuko

    **Solution:**

    - Export reviews from all three platforms
    - Combine into single CSV
    - De-duplicate (same review may exist on multiple platforms)
    - Import combined CSV to Yuko

    **Scenario 2: Platform reviews + Google reviews**

    - Product reviews in WooCommerce
    - Shop reviews on Google Business
    - Want both in Yuko

    **Solution:**

    - Import WooCommerce reviews as product reviews
    - Import Google reviews as shop/site reviews
    - Keep them separate (different purposes)

    **Scenario 3: Multiple review apps**

    - Used Judge.me for some products
    - Used Loox for other products
    - Want all in Yuko

    **Solution:**

    - Export from both apps
    - Combine CSVs
    - Ensure product IDs match
    - Import combined data

    **How to combine multiple sources:**

    **Step 1: Export from each source**

    - Export Review Platform A
    - Export Review Platform B
    - Export Review Platform C

    **Step 2: Standardize formats**

    - Align column names across all CSVs
    - Ensure consistent date formats
    - Standardize product IDs
    - Match reviewer name formats

    **Step 3: Combine into single CSV**

    - Merge all CSVs into one file
    - Sort by product ID or date
    - Check for duplicates

    **Step 4: De-duplicate**

    - Look for same reviewer + product + date
    - Remove exact duplicates
    - For near-duplicates, keep best version (with photos, more detail)

    **Step 5: Import combined CSV**

    - Upload to Yuko
    - Map fields
    - Import all at once

    **De-duplication tips:**

    **Exact duplicates:**

    - Same reviewer name
    - Same product
    - Same review text
    - Same date

    **Action:** Delete duplicate, keep one

    **Near duplicates:**

    - Same reviewer
    - Same product
    - Similar text but not identical
    - Different dates (maybe edited/updated)

    **Action:** Keep most recent or most detailed

    **Tools for de-duplication:**

    - Excel: Remove duplicates feature
    - Google Sheets: UNIQUE function
    - CSV tools: csvkit, pandas
    - Manual review for small counts

    <Warning>
      **Important:** When combining sources, watch for duplicate reviews. Same customer may have left review on multiple platforms. De-duplicate before import to avoid showing same review twice.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to delete old reviews after importing?" icon="trash">
    **Yes - eventually, but not immediately**

    **Recommended timeline:**

    **Week 1: Keep both systems**

    - Import reviews to Yuko
    - Display Yuko reviews on site
    - Keep old system active (hidden or deactivated)
    - Monitor for issues

    **Why:**

    - Backup in case import had issues
    - Can reference old system if needed
    - Test Yuko thoroughly before committing
    - Easy rollback if problems

    **Week 2-3: Verify everything works**

    - Check all reviews imported correctly
    - Verify SEO maintained (Google Search Console)
    - Monitor conversion rates
    - Test mobile and desktop display
    - Ensure no duplicate reviews showing

    **Week 4: Remove old system**

    - Once confident Yuko is working perfectly
    - Deactivate old review plugin
    - Remove old review display widgets
    - Keep data backup (export old reviews to CSV)

    **Database cleanup (optional):**

    - Delete old review tables from database
    - Improves site performance
    - Reduces database size
    - Do this last, after everything verified

    **What to do with old review data:**

    **Option 1: Archive (recommended)**

    - Export old reviews to CSV
    - Save file securely (cloud storage)
    - Keep as backup/reference
    - Don't delete permanently

    **Option 2: Delete completely**

    - If 100% confident in import
    - Free up database space
    - Clean slate
    - **Risky** - hard to reverse

    **Option 3: Keep old system deactivated**

    - Don't delete, just disable
    - Data remains in database
    - Can reactivate if needed
    - No performance impact if deactivated

    **SEO consideration when removing:**

    **If old reviews had schema markup:**

    - Verify Yuko has schema markup active
    - Check Google Rich Results Test
    - Monitor search rankings for 2 weeks
    - Watch for drops in organic traffic

    **If old review URLs were indexed:**

    - Set up 301 redirects to new review URLs
    - Or use same URL structure in Yuko
    - Update sitemap
    - Let Google re-crawl

    **Signs it's safe to delete old system:**

    - ✅ All reviews verified in Yuko
    - ✅ No duplicate reviews showing
    - ✅ SEO metrics stable (no traffic drop)
    - ✅ Conversion rates maintained or improved
    - ✅ No customer complaints about missing reviews
    - ✅ Old review data exported and backed up

    <Tip>
      **Best practice:** Keep old review system deactivated (not deleted) for 30-60 days after migration. This gives you peace of mind and easy rollback option if any issues discovered. After 60 days, export old data as backup and delete.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will customers be notified about imported reviews?" icon="bell">
    **No - customers are not notified when their reviews are imported**

    **What happens during import:**

    **Customer perspective:**

    - Their review appears on new system (Yuko)
    - No email notification sent
    - No action required from them
    - Review just "moves" to new platform

    **Privacy and consent:**

    **Is importing customer reviews legal?**

    - Yes, reviews are your business data
    - Customer submitted review to your store
    - Moving between platforms is data management
    - No new use of customer data

    **GDPR/Privacy considerations:**

    - Customer data (name, email) can be migrated
    - Reviews are part of product catalog
    - No consent needed for platform migration
    - Customer has right to request deletion

    **Email addresses in imported reviews:**

    - Used for verification matching only
    - Not displayed publicly (Yuko hides emails)
    - Not used for marketing without consent
    - Same privacy as original platform

    **When you SHOULD notify customers:**

    **Scenario 1: Requesting review updates**

    - If you want customers to update their reviews
    - If asking customers to add photos to existing reviews
    - If requesting they verify their review on new platform

    **Scenario 2: Review editing enabled**

    - If you enable customers to edit reviews in Yuko
    - Send email: "Your reviews are now in our new system, edit them here: [link]"

    **Scenario 3: Review rewards program**

    - If offering rewards for existing reviews
    - "Thanks for your past reviews! Here's 10% off as appreciation"

    **When you DON'T need to notify:**

    **Scenario 1: Simple platform migration**

    - Moving from WooCommerce to Yuko
    - Reviews remain the same
    - No customer action needed

    **Scenario 2: Review aggregation**

    - Combining reviews from multiple sources
    - Displaying existing reviews in better format
    - No change to review content

    **What if customer asks about their review?**

    **Customer: "I left a review, where did it go?"**

    **Response:** "Your review is still here! We upgraded our review system to Yuko for better features. Your review and star rating are now displayed [on this page: link]. Nothing about your review changed - just the platform displaying it."

    **Customer: "I want to delete my old review"**

    **Response:** "No problem! Your review is now managed in our new Yuko system. You can delete it here: [link] or email us at [support email] and we'll remove it immediately."

    **Customer: "Can I edit my old review?"**

    **Response:** "Yes! We've migrated your review to our new system where you can edit it. Here's your review link: [unique link]. You can update the text, rating, or add photos."

    <Note>
      **Best practice:** While notification isn't required, consider sending a one-time email to past reviewers after migration: "We've upgraded our review system! Your reviews are now live on our improved platform. Check them out: [link]". This is optional but can boost engagement.

  **Pro tip:** Don't rush the import. Test with 10-20 reviews first, verify everything works perfectly, then import your full review database. Taking an extra hour to test saves days of fixing import mistakes.
