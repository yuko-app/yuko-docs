### **Overview**

Migrating your reviews into Yuko helps you maintain credibility and SEO value when switching platforms.\
Yuko’s importer ensures that all review data — including author, rating, date, and media — transfers cleanly.

You can import reviews in two main ways:

- Direct integration (for WooCommerce and [Judge.me](http://Judge.me))
- Manual CSV upload (for other sources, coming soon)
