## Import Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clean Up Reviews Before Importing" defaultOpen icon="broom">
    **Import only quality reviews - clean up spam/fake reviews first**

    **What to remove before importing:**

    **Obvious spam:**
    - Gibberish text ("asdf", "test", "...")
    - Random characters or copy-paste spam
    - Links to competitor sites
    - Completely off-topic reviews

    **Fake reviews:**
    - Multiple reviews from same email
    - Reviews for products that don't exist
    - Suspicious patterns (all 5-stars in one day)
    - Bot-generated content

    **Low-value reviews:**
    - Empty reviews (star only, no text) - Optional: Keep if high rating
    - Extremely short unhelpful reviews ("ok", "fine")
    - Reviews for wrong products
    - Duplicate reviews from same customer

    **Outdated reviews:**
    - Reviews for discontinued products (unless archiving)
    - Reviews mentioning old policies no longer relevant
    - Extremely old reviews (5+ years) that may not reflect current quality

    **Why clean before import:**
    - Cleaner data from day one
    - Easier than cleaning after import
    - Better first impression in Yuko
    - Higher average review quality
    - Improved SEO value

    **How to clean:**
    - In current platform: Delete spam/fake reviews
    - In CSV: Remove rows before uploading
    - After import: Use Yuko moderation tools

    <Tip>
    **Balance:** Don't be too aggressive. Keep all legitimate reviews, even 1-2 star reviews. Only remove obvious spam and fake content.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Preserve Review Dates" icon="calendar">
    **Keep original review dates - don't import everything as "today"**

    **Why dates matter:**

    **Authenticity:**
    - Reviews spread over time look natural
    - All reviews "today" looks suspicious
    - Customers notice date patterns
    - Builds trust when reviews span months/years

    **SEO value:**
    - Search engines value review history
    - Recent reviews + older reviews = better
    - Shows consistent customer satisfaction
    - Review freshness matters for rankings

    **Customer insights:**
    - See product quality over time
    - Track improvements from feedback
    - Seasonal product patterns
    - Long-term durability feedback

    **How to preserve dates:**

    **Automatic imports:**
    - WooCommerce: Dates auto-preserved
    - Judge.me: Dates auto-preserved
    - Platform integrations maintain dates

    **CSV imports:**
    - Include `date` column in CSV
    - Format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-03-15)
    - Yuko will use provided dates
    - If no date, defaults to import date

    **Example CSV:**
    ```
    product_id,rating,review_text,reviewer_name,date
    12345,5,"Great product!",John S.,2024-01-15
    12345,4,"Good quality",Sarah M.,2024-02-03
    ```

    <Check>
    **Best practice:** Always include review dates in CSV imports. If dates aren't available, spread imports across multiple days instead of one bulk import.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Match Products Correctly" icon="link">
    **Ensure reviews import to the correct products**

    **Common product matching issues:**

    **Issue 1: Different product IDs**
    - Old platform used SKU "ABC123"
    - New platform uses ID "456"
    - Import fails or assigns to wrong product

    **Solution:**
    - Create product ID mapping (old ID → new ID)
    - Update CSV with correct new product IDs
    - Use SKU matching if available

    **Issue 2: Product name changes**
    - Product renamed during migration
    - Reviews reference old name
    - Customer confusion

    **Solution:**
    - Use product ID, not name for matching
    - Update review text if product renamed significantly
    - Add note in review explaining name change

    **Issue 3: Discontinued products**
    - Old product no longer sold
    - Reviews exist but no product page
    - Where do reviews go?

    **Solution:**
    - Option 1: Import to replacement product (if similar)
    - Option 2: Archive reviews (viewable but not displayed)
    - Option 3: Skip import for discontinued items

    **Issue 4: Product variants/variations**
    - Review for "Blue Shirt, Size M"
    - Should it show for all sizes? Just blue? Just medium blue?

    **Solution:**
    - Import to parent product (shows for all variants)
    - Or import to specific variant (only shows for that variant)
    - Document variant matching approach

    **How to verify product matching:**

    **Before import:**
    - Export product list from new platform
    - Match old product IDs to new IDs
    - Create mapping spreadsheet
    - Update import CSV with new IDs

    **After import:**
    - Check random product pages
    - Verify reviews appear on correct products
    - Look for products with zero reviews (may be matching issue)
    - Check for products with suspiciously high review counts (may have duplicates)

    <Warning>
    **Critical:** Test product matching with a small sample import (10-20 reviews) before importing thousands of reviews. Fix matching issues before full import.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Import Photos and Videos" icon="camera">
    **Bring visual content with reviews**

    **Photo/video import challenges:**

    **Challenge 1: Photos stored locally**
    - Old platform has photos on their server
    - Can't direct link after leaving platform
    - Photos will break after migration

    **Solution:**
    - Download all review photos before migrating
    - Upload to your hosting or CDN
    - Provide new photo URLs in CSV
    - Yuko re-hosts photos permanently

    **Challenge 2: Large file sizes**
    - Thousands of review photos
    - Huge total file size
    - Slow import process

    **Solution:**
    - Compress photos before import (optimize for web)
    - Use CDN for photo hosting
    - Import photos in batches
    - Prioritize photos for high-value reviews

    **Challenge 3: Missing photo URLs**
    - CSV has reviews but no photo column
    - Photos exist but not linked
    - Manual work to reconnect

    **Solution:**
    - Export photos from old platform separately
    - Match photos to reviews by review ID
    - Add photo URLs to CSV manually
    - Or upload photos after import via Yuko dashboard

    **Best approach for photo imports:**

    **Option 1: Platform integration (automatic)**
    - Judge.me import: Photos auto-imported
    - API connections: Photos included
    - No manual work needed

    **Option 2: CSV with photo URLs**
    - Export photos to hosting (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
    - Get public URLs for each photo
    - Add `photo_url` column to CSV
    - Yuko downloads and re-hosts photos

    **Option 3: Manual upload after import**
    - Import reviews without photos first
    - Go to each review in Yuko dashboard
    - Manually add photos to reviews
    - Time-consuming but works for small counts

    **CSV format for photos:**
    ```
    product_id,rating,review_text,reviewer_name,photo_url
    12345,5,"Love it!",Sarah,https://cdn.example.com/photo1.jpg
    12346,4,"Great",Mike,https://cdn.example.com/photo2.jpg|https://cdn.example.com/photo3.jpg
    ```

    Multiple photos: Separate URLs with pipe `|` character

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Prioritize photo imports for 5-star reviews. These are most valuable for conversion. Import text-only reviews immediately, add photos to top reviews manually later if needed.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maintain Verified Purchase Status" icon="badge-check">
    **Keep "Verified Purchase" badges during import**

    **Why verified badges matter:**
    - 70% more trusted than unverified reviews
    - Reduces fake review concerns
    - Higher conversion impact
    - Maintains credibility during migration

    **How verified status works:**

    **In original platform:**
    - Customer purchased product
    - Order ID linked to review
    - Platform marks review as "verified"

    **During import to Yuko:**
    - Yuko needs to match review to order
    - Uses email address or order ID
    - If match found: Verified badge applied
    - If no match: Review imported as unverified

    **How to preserve verified status:**

    **Method 1: Email matching (automatic)**
    - Import includes reviewer email
    - Yuko checks email against order history
    - If email has order for that product: Verified
    - If no order found: Unverified

    **Requirement:** Reviewer email must match order email exactly

    **Method 2: Order ID matching**
    - CSV includes `order_id` column
    - Yuko matches review to specific order
    - Most accurate verification method

    **Requirement:** Order IDs must exist in current system

    **Method 3: Manual verified flag**
    - CSV includes `verified` column (true/false)
    - Yuko trusts your data
    - No automatic verification

    **Requirement:** You verify accuracy of verified status

    **CSV example with verification:**
    ```
    product_id,rating,review_text,email,verified,order_id
    12345,5,"Great!",sarah@email.com,true,ORDER-123
    12346,4,"Good",mike@email.com,false,
    ```

    **Best practices:**
    - Always include reviewer email for verification
    - Include order IDs if available
    - Let Yuko auto-verify based on orders
    - Don't manually mark all as verified (reduces trust)

    <Check>
    **Recommended:** Use email matching. Most reliable and automatic. Yuko cross-references emails with your WooCommerce/Shopify orders and applies verified badges accordingly.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test with Small Import First" icon="flask">
    **Always test with 10-50 reviews before full import**

    **Why test first:**

    **Catch errors early:**
    - Product ID mismatches
    - Date formatting issues
    - Photo URL problems
    - Character encoding errors
    - Column mapping mistakes

    **Easier to fix:**
    - Fix 20 reviews manually: 10 minutes
    - Fix 2,000 reviews: Hours or impossible
    - Delete test import and retry: Easy
    - Delete 10,000 imports: Messy

    **Verify settings:**
    - See how reviews display
    - Check mobile view
    - Test verified badges
    - Ensure no duplicates
    - Validate review quality

    **How to test:**

    **Step 1: Create test CSV**
    - Export 10-20 diverse reviews
    - Include different ratings (1-5 stars)
    - Mix verified and unverified
    - Include reviews with/without photos
    - Cover multiple products

    **Step 2: Import test batch**
    - Use Yuko import function
    - Upload test CSV
    - Complete import process
    - Check for errors

    **Step 3: Verify results**
    - Check product pages
    - Verify review content accurate
    - Test display on desktop/mobile
    - Ensure photos load
    - Confirm verified badges

    **Step 4: Fix issues**
    - Identify any problems
    - Update CSV format
    - Fix product ID mapping
    - Adjust date formats
    - Re-test

    **Step 5: Delete test import**
    - Clear test reviews
    - Start fresh with full import
    - Use perfected CSV format

    **Common test discoveries:**
    - "Our product IDs were wrong" ✅ Fixed before full import
    - "Dates imported as today" ✅ Fixed format
    - "Photos not loading" ✅ Updated URLs
    - "Special characters broke" ✅ Changed encoding
    - "Reviews duplicated" ✅ Prevented in full import

    <Warning>
    **Never skip testing:** Importing 10,000 reviews wrong is a nightmare to fix. Always test with 10-50 reviews first, verify everything works, then import the full dataset.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will imported reviews affect my SEO?" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Yes - imported reviews maintain SEO value (if done correctly)**

    **SEO benefits of imported reviews:**

    **Preserved content:**
    - Review text is valuable indexed content
    - Keywords in reviews help product page rankings
    - More content = better SEO
    - Google sees review history

    **Rich snippets maintained:**
    - Star ratings show in search results
    - Review count displays
    - Product rating markup
    - Enhanced search listings

    **Fresh + historical content:**
    - Mix of old and new reviews is ideal
    - Shows product history and consistency
    - Recent reviews + established history
    - Better than starting from zero

    **How to maintain SEO value:**

    **1. Preserve review dates**
    - Don't import all as "today"
    - Keep original review dates
    - Shows natural review pattern

    **2. Keep review content intact**
    - Don't edit or paraphrase reviews
    - Maintain original text
    - Preserve keywords customers used

    **3. Implement schema markup**
    - Use Review schema (schema.org)
    - Include AggregateRating markup
    - Yuko handles this automatically

    **4. Don't remove old reviews immediately**
    - Keep both systems running briefly (1-2 weeks)
    - Monitor search rankings
    - Gradual transition vs sudden removal

    **5. Set up redirects if needed**
    - If review URLs changed
    - 301 redirects from old to new
    - Preserve link equity

    **Potential SEO risks:**

    **Risk 1: Duplicate content**
    - Reviews exist on old platform AND Yuko
    - Google sees duplicates
    - Confused about canonical version

    **Solution:** Remove old reviews once Yuko is live

    **Risk 2: Lost review markup**
    - Old system had schema, new doesn't
    - Rich snippets disappear from search
    - Click-through rate drops

    **Solution:** Yuko auto-adds schema markup

    **Risk 3: URL structure changes**
    - Review URLs different in Yuko
    - Indexed review links break
    - 404 errors

    **Solution:** Set up redirects or use same URL structure

    **Monitor SEO during transition:**
    - Google Search Console: Check impressions/clicks
    - Rich results test: Verify markup working
    - Product page rankings: Monitor positions
    - Organic traffic: Watch for drops

    <Tip>
    **Best practice:** Import reviews → verify schema markup → keep old system live for 1 week → remove old reviews → monitor SEO for 2 weeks. This gradual approach minimizes SEO risk.

  <Accordion title="What happens to reviews I can't import?" icon="question">
    **Options for handling reviews that can't be imported**

    **Common scenarios:**

    **Scenario 1: Reviews for discontinued products**
    - Product no longer sold
    - No destination product page
    - Where do reviews go?

    **Options:**
    - Archive reviews (saved but not displayed)
    - Import to similar replacement product
    - Skip import for those reviews
    - Create "Discontinued Products" page with reviews

    **Recommended:** Archive for records, skip display

    **Scenario 2: Reviews with broken photo links**
    - Photos hosted on old platform
    - Links will break after migration
    - Can't access photos

    **Options:**
    - Import review without photos (text only)
    - Manually download and re-upload photos
    - Skip reviews that rely heavily on photos
    - Contact old platform for photo export

    **Recommended:** Import text, manually add photos to high-value reviews

    **Scenario 3: Reviews in wrong format**
    - Date format incompatible
    - Character encoding issues
    - Missing required fields

    **Options:**
    - Manually fix in CSV before import
    - Import what you can, skip problematic rows
    - Contact Yuko support for help
    - Use data transformation tools

    **Recommended:** Fix CSV format, re-import

    **Scenario 4: Duplicate reviews**
    - Same review appears multiple times
    - Customer reviewed same product twice
    - Import has duplicates

    **Options:**
    - De-duplicate CSV before import
    - Import all, manually delete duplicates after
    - Keep most recent review, skip older ones
    - Keep highest-value review (photos, detailed text)

    **Recommended:** De-duplicate before import

    **Scenario 5: Reviews in other languages**
    - Non-English reviews
    - Multiple languages mixed
    - Unsure if to import

    **Options:**
    - Import all languages (Yuko supports multilingual)
    - Filter by language before import
    - Translate reviews before import
    - Tag reviews by language

    **Recommended:** Import all, let customers filter by language

    **What to do with unmportable reviews:**

    **Option 1: Manual entry**
    - Manually add important reviews via Yuko dashboard
    - Time-consuming but works for small counts
    - Good for high-value reviews (5-star with photos)

    **Option 2: Archive for reference**
    - Save old reviews in spreadsheet
    - Keep for internal reference
    - Don't display publicly
    - Use insights for product development

    **Option 3: Screenshot for social media**
    - Can't import but still valuable
    - Use screenshots in marketing
    - Post on social media
    - Include in email campaigns

    <Check>
    **Pro tip:** Focus import efforts on high-quality, recent reviews with photos. Don't stress about importing every single review. Quality over quantity.

  <Accordion title="Can I import reviews from multiple sources?" icon="layer-group">
    **Yes - combine reviews from different platforms**

    **Common multi-source scenarios:**

    **Scenario 1: Platform migration + previous platform**
    - Migrated from Magento to Shopify to WooCommerce
    - Reviews scattered across all three platforms
    - Want to consolidate everything in Yuko

    **Solution:**
    - Export reviews from all three platforms
    - Combine into single CSV
    - De-duplicate (same review may exist on multiple platforms)
    - Import combined CSV to Yuko

    **Scenario 2: Platform reviews + Google reviews**
    - Product reviews in WooCommerce
    - Shop reviews on Google Business
    - Want both in Yuko

    **Solution:**
    - Import WooCommerce reviews as product reviews
    - Import Google reviews as shop/site reviews
    - Keep them separate (different purposes)

    **Scenario 3: Multiple review apps**
    - Used Judge.me for some products
    - Used Loox for other products
    - Want all in Yuko

    **Solution:**
    - Export from both apps
    - Combine CSVs
    - Ensure product IDs match
    - Import combined data

    **How to combine multiple sources:**

    **Step 1: Export from each source**
    - Export Review Platform A
    - Export Review Platform B
    - Export Review Platform C

    **Step 2: Standardize formats**
    - Align column names across all CSVs
    - Ensure consistent date formats
    - Standardize product IDs
    - Match reviewer name formats

    **Step 3: Combine into single CSV**
    - Merge all CSVs into one file
    - Sort by product ID or date
    - Check for duplicates

    **Step 4: De-duplicate**
    - Look for same reviewer + product + date
    - Remove exact duplicates
    - For near-duplicates, keep best version (with photos, more detail)

    **Step 5: Import combined CSV**
    - Upload to Yuko
    - Map fields
    - Import all at once

    **De-duplication tips:**

    **Exact duplicates:**
    - Same reviewer name
    - Same product
    - Same review text
    - Same date

    **Action:** Delete duplicate, keep one

    **Near duplicates:**
    - Same reviewer
    - Same product
    - Similar text but not identical
    - Different dates (maybe edited/updated)

    **Action:** Keep most recent or most detailed

    **Tools for de-duplication:**
    - Excel: Remove duplicates feature
    - Google Sheets: UNIQUE function
    - CSV tools: csvkit, pandas
    - Manual review for small counts

    <Warning>
    **Important:** When combining sources, watch for duplicate reviews. Same customer may have left review on multiple platforms. De-duplicate before import to avoid showing same review twice.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to delete old reviews after importing?" icon="trash">
    **Yes - eventually, but not immediately**

    **Recommended timeline:**

    **Week 1: Keep both systems**
    - Import reviews to Yuko
    - Display Yuko reviews on site
    - Keep old system active (hidden or deactivated)
    - Monitor for issues

    **Why:**
    - Backup in case import had issues
    - Can reference old system if needed
    - Test Yuko thoroughly before committing
    - Easy rollback if problems

    **Week 2-3: Verify everything works**
    - Check all reviews imported correctly
    - Verify SEO maintained (Google Search Console)
    - Monitor conversion rates
    - Test mobile and desktop display
    - Ensure no duplicate reviews showing

    **Week 4: Remove old system**
    - Once confident Yuko is working perfectly
    - Deactivate old review plugin
    - Remove old review display widgets
    - Keep data backup (export old reviews to CSV)

    **Database cleanup (optional):**
    - Delete old review tables from database
    - Improves site performance
    - Reduces database size
    - Do this last, after everything verified

    **What to do with old review data:**

    **Option 1: Archive (recommended)**
    - Export old reviews to CSV
    - Save file securely (cloud storage)
    - Keep as backup/reference
    - Don't delete permanently

    **Option 2: Delete completely**
    - If 100% confident in import
    - Free up database space
    - Clean slate
    - **Risky** - hard to reverse

    **Option 3: Keep old system deactivated**
    - Don't delete, just disable
    - Data remains in database
    - Can reactivate if needed
    - No performance impact if deactivated

    **SEO consideration when removing:**

    **If old reviews had schema markup:**
    - Verify Yuko has schema markup active
    - Check Google Rich Results Test
    - Monitor search rankings for 2 weeks
    - Watch for drops in organic traffic

    **If old review URLs were indexed:**
    - Set up 301 redirects to new review URLs
    - Or use same URL structure in Yuko
    - Update sitemap
    - Let Google re-crawl

    **Signs it's safe to delete old system:**
    - ✅ All reviews verified in Yuko
    - ✅ No duplicate reviews showing
    - ✅ SEO metrics stable (no traffic drop)
    - ✅ Conversion rates maintained or improved
    - ✅ No customer complaints about missing reviews
    - ✅ Old review data exported and backed up

    <Tip>
    **Best practice:** Keep old review system deactivated (not deleted) for 30-60 days after migration. This gives you peace of mind and easy rollback option if any issues discovered. After 60 days, export old data as backup and delete.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will customers be notified about imported reviews?" icon="bell">
    **No - customers are not notified when their reviews are imported**

    **What happens during import:**

    **Customer perspective:**
    - Their review appears on new system (Yuko)
    - No email notification sent
    - No action required from them
    - Review just "moves" to new platform

    **Privacy and consent:**

    **Is importing customer reviews legal?**
    - Yes, reviews are your business data
    - Customer submitted review to your store
    - Moving between platforms is data management
    - No new use of customer data

    **GDPR/Privacy considerations:**
    - Customer data (name, email) can be migrated
    - Reviews are part of product catalog
    - No consent needed for platform migration
    - Customer has right to request deletion

    **Email addresses in imported reviews:**
    - Used for verification matching only
    - Not displayed publicly (Yuko hides emails)
    - Not used for marketing without consent
    - Same privacy as original platform

    **When you SHOULD notify customers:**

    **Scenario 1: Requesting review updates**
    - If you want customers to update their reviews
    - If asking customers to add photos to existing reviews
    - If requesting they verify their review on new platform

    **Scenario 2: Review editing enabled**
    - If you enable customers to edit reviews in Yuko
    - Send email: "Your reviews are now in our new system, edit them here: [link]"

    **Scenario 3: Review rewards program**
    - If offering rewards for existing reviews
    - "Thanks for your past reviews! Here's 10% off as appreciation"

    **When you DON'T need to notify:**

    **Scenario 1: Simple platform migration**
    - Moving from WooCommerce to Yuko
    - Reviews remain the same
    - No customer action needed

    **Scenario 2: Review aggregation**
    - Combining reviews from multiple sources
    - Displaying existing reviews in better format
    - No change to review content

    **What if customer asks about their review?**

    **Customer: "I left a review, where did it go?"**

    **Response:**
    "Your review is still here! We upgraded our review system to Yuko for better features. Your review and star rating are now displayed [on this page: link]. Nothing about your review changed - just the platform displaying it."

    **Customer: "I want to delete my old review"**

    **Response:**
    "No problem! Your review is now managed in our new Yuko system. You can delete it here: [link] or email us at [support email] and we'll remove it immediately."

    **Customer: "Can I edit my old review?"**

    **Response:**
    "Yes! We've migrated your review to our new system where you can edit it. Here's your review link: [unique link]. You can update the text, rating, or add photos."

    <Note>
    **Best practice:** While notification isn't required, consider sending a one-time email to past reviewers after migration: "We've upgraded our review system! Your reviews are now live on our improved platform. Check them out: [link]". This is optional but can boost engagement.

**Pro tip:** Don't rush the import. Test with 10-20 reviews first, verify everything works perfectly, then import your full review database. Taking an extra hour to test saves days of fixing import mistakes.
