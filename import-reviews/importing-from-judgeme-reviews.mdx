    **In Judge.me:**
    1. Log in to Judge.me dashboard
    2. Go to Settings → Export Reviews
    3. Select export format: CSV
    4. Choose data to include (reviews, photos, verified status)
    5. Click "Export" and download file

    **What gets exported:**
    - All product reviews

    **File format:**
    - CSV file (spreadsheet format)
    - Can open in Excel/Google Sheets
    - Contains all review data
    - Usually 1-10MB depending on review count
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare CSV for Yuko" icon="table">
    Format the Judge.me export for Yuko import.

    **Column mapping:**
    - Judge.me column names → Yuko column names
    - Product SKU/ID matching
    - Date format standardization
    - Photo URL validation

    **Yuko provides:**
    - CSV template for Judge.me imports
    - Auto-mapping tool (most fields auto-detected)
    - Field matching preview
    - Error detection before import

    **Common adjustments:**
    - Ensure product IDs match your store
    - Verify photo URLs are accessible
    - Check date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
    - Confirm email addresses included (for verified badges)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload CSV to Yuko" icon="upload">
    Import your Judge.me reviews to Yuko.

    **In Yuko Dashboard:**
    1. Go to Reviews → Import → Judge.me
    2. Upload CSV file
    3. Map CSV columns to Yuko fields
    4. Preview sample reviews
    5. Start import

    **During import:**
    - Progress bar shows status
    - Photo/video downloads processed
    - Product matching happens automatically
    - Errors reported in real-time

    **Import time:**
    - 100 reviews: 2-5 minutes
    - 1,000 reviews: 10-20 minutes
    - 5,000 reviews: 30-60 minutes
    - 10,000+ reviews: 1-3 hours
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic Product Matching" icon="link">
    Yuko matches Judge.me reviews to your products.

    **Matching methods:**
    1. Product SKU (most reliable)
    2. Product ID
    3. Product name (fallback)
    4. Manual assignment (if no match)

    **Match rate:**
    - 95-99% automatic matching
    - Unmatched reviews flagged for manual assignment
    - Can assign in Yuko dashboard after import

    **Why mismatches happen:**
    - Product SKU changed
    - Product discontinued
    - Product name different in Judge.me vs store
    - Typos in product data
  </Step>

  <Step title="Photo & Video Download" icon="camera">
    Yuko downloads and re-hosts media files.

    **What happens to photos:**
    - Yuko reads photo URLs from CSV
    - Downloads photos from Judge.me servers
    - Re-uploads to Yuko hosting
    - Attaches to corresponding reviews
    - Original photos remain in Judge.me (backup)

    **What happens to videos:**
    - Video URLs from CSV
    - Yuko downloads or embeds videos
    - Hosted on Yuko or embedded from source
    - Displayed in review widgets

    **Why re-hosting matters:**
    - Judge.me URLs break after you leave platform
    - Yuko hosting ensures photos stay live
    - Faster loading (CDN)
    - Independent of Judge.me
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify and Display" icon="eye">
    Check imported reviews and enable display.

    **Verification checklist:**
    - Total review count matches Judge.me
    - Photos displaying correctly
    - Verified badges showing
    - Dates preserved
    - Reviews on correct products

    **Enable display:**
    - Install Yuko review widgets
    - Check product pages
    - Test mobile and desktop
    - Verify photo galleries working

## Step-by-Step Import Instructions

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Import → Judge.me**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Export Reviews from Judge.me" defaultOpen icon="download">
    **Download all your review data from Judge.me**

    **Navigation in Judge.me:**
    1. Log in to your Judge.me account
    2. Click "Settings" in left sidebar
    3. Scroll to "Export Reviews" section
    4. Click "Export to CSV"

    **Export options:**

    **What to include:**
    - ✅ All reviews (approved + pending)
    - ✅ Review photos and videos
    - ✅ Verified purchase status
    - ✅ Review dates
    - ✅ Reviewer information
    - ✅ Product mappings (SKU or ID)

    **Date range:**
    - All time (recommended)
    - Or specific date range if you only want recent reviews

    **Export file:**
    - Judge.me generates CSV file
    - Download to your computer
    - File typically named: `judgeme-reviews-export.csv`
    - Size depends on review count (1KB - 50MB)

    **What's included in CSV:**
    ```
    product_sku, review_title, review_body, rating, reviewer_name,
    reviewer_email, verified_buyer, review_date, photo_urls, video_urls
    ```

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Export all reviews, even pending ones. You can filter in Yuko after import. Better to have everything than discover you're missing reviews later.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Prepare CSV for Yuko Import" icon="table">
    **Format Judge.me export for Yuko compatibility**

    **Open CSV file:**
    - Use Excel, Google Sheets, or text editor
    - Review column headers
    - Check data formatting

    **Required columns for Yuko:**
    - `product_id` or `product_sku` - Product identifier
    - `rating` - Star rating (1-5)
    - `review_text` - Review content
    - `reviewer_name` - Customer name
    - `date` - Review submission date (YYYY-MM-DD)

    **Optional but recommended:**
    - `email` - For verified purchase matching
    - `title` - Review headline
    - `verified` - true/false
    - `photo_urls` - Comma-separated photo URLs
    - `video_url` - Video URL

    **Common formatting issues to fix:**

    **Issue 1: Date format**
    - Judge.me exports: `12/15/2023` or `2023-12-15T10:30:00`
    - Yuko needs: `2023-12-15`
    - Fix: Use Excel date formatting or find/replace

    **Issue 2: Product SKU mismatch**
    - Judge.me SKU might not match your current store
    - Verify SKUs match Yuko product database
    - Update CSV if needed before import

    **Issue 3: Photo URLs**
    - Ensure photo URLs start with `http://` or `https://`
    - Multiple photos: Separate with pipe `|` character
    - Example: `https://cdn.judgeme.com/photo1.jpg|https://cdn.judgeme.com/photo2.jpg`

    **Issue 4: Special characters**
    - Ensure CSV is UTF-8 encoded
    - Handles international characters, emojis
    - Save as "CSV UTF-8" in Excel

    **Download Yuko CSV template:**
    - Yuko provides Judge.me import template
    - Shows exact column names needed
    - Includes sample data
    - Available in import wizard

    <Check>
    **Best practice:** Don't edit review content. Only fix formatting (dates, URLs). Keep reviews exactly as customers wrote them for authenticity.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 3: Upload CSV to Yuko" icon="upload">
    **Import your prepared CSV file**

    **In Yuko Dashboard:**

    2. Select "Import from Judge.me"
    3. Click "Upload CSV File"

    5. Wait for upload to complete

    - Estimated time

    **After upload:**

    ```
    Judge.me Column       → Yuko Field

    - Confirm photo URLs valid
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 4: Configure Import Settings" icon="sliders">
    **Choose import options**

    **Product matching:**

    **Option 1: Match by SKU** (recommended)
    - Most reliable method
    - Matches Judge.me product SKU to Yuko product SKU
    - 95-98% success rate
    - Best for: Stores with consistent SKUs

    **Option 2: Match by Product ID**
    - Uses product ID instead of SKU
    - Good if SKUs changed but IDs stable
    - 90-95% success rate
    - Best for: Migrated stores with ID continuity

    **Option 3: Match by product name**
    - Fallback if SKU/ID not available
    - Less reliable (typos, name changes)
    - 70-85% success rate
    - Best for: Last resort

    **Verified purchase handling:**

    **Re-verify based on email:**
    - Judge.me "Verified Buyer" imported
    - Yuko also checks reviewer email against order database
    - Applies "Verified Purchase" if order found
    - Most accurate verification method
    - **Recommended**

    **Trust Judge.me verified status:**
    - Imports Judge.me verified flag as-is
    - No additional verification
    - Faster import
    - Use if confident in Judge.me data

    **Import as unverified:**
    - Ignore verified status from Judge.me
    - Import all reviews as unverified
    - Manually verify later if needed
    - Not recommended (loses trust signals)

    **Photo/video import:**

    **Download and re-host (recommended):**
    - Yuko downloads photos from Judge.me URLs
    - Re-hosts on Yuko servers
    - Ensures photos stay live after leaving Judge.me
    - Slower import but safer

    **Link to original URLs:**
    - Keep Judge.me photo URLs as-is
    - Faster import
    - **Risk:** Photos break after leaving Judge.me
    - Not recommended

    **Skip photos:**
    - Import reviews without photos
    - Fastest import
    - Can manually add photos later
    - Use if photos causing import issues

    **Review status:**

    **Import approved reviews:**
    - ✅ Approved reviews → Published in Yuko
    - Appear immediately on site

    **Import pending reviews:**
    - ✅ Pending reviews → Pending in Yuko
    - Moderate before publishing

    **Skip spam/rejected:**
    - ❌ Don't import spam or rejected reviews
    - Clean start in Yuko

    **Recommended settings:**
    - Product matching: Match by SKU
    - Verified: Re-verify based on email
    - Photos: Download and re-host

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Photos not importing from Judge.me" icon="image">
    **Review photos missing or failing to download**

    **Common causes:**
    - Photo URLs in CSV are broken/expired
    - Judge.me deleted photos after export
    - Network timeout during download
    - File format not supported

    **Solutions:**

    **Solution 1: Retry photo download**
    - In Yuko, go to Import History
    - Find Judge.me import
    - Click "Retry Failed Photos"
    - Yuko attempts re-download

    **Solution 2: Re-export from Judge.me with fresh URLs**
    - Some photo URLs expire quickly
    - Export reviews from Judge.me again
    - Get fresh photo URLs
    - Re-import (Yuko skips duplicate reviews, only imports photos)

    **Solution 3: Manually upload important photos**
    - Identify high-value reviews (5-star, detailed)
    - Download photos from Judge.me manually
    - Upload to those reviews in Yuko dashboard
    - Time-consuming but works for select reviews

    **Solution 4: Contact Judge.me support**
    - If many photos failing
    - Judge.me may have export issue
    - Request proper photo export
    - Or photo CDN URLs

    **Expected photo import rate:**
    - 90-95% success rate normal
    - 5-10% failure acceptable (often old/deleted photos)
    - If less than 80% success, investigate
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Product matching issues" icon="link-slash">
    **Reviews not matching to correct products**

    **Why this happens:**
    - Product SKU different in Judge.me vs your store
    - Product name changed
    - Product deleted/discontinued
    - SKU typo in CSV

    **Solutions:**

    **Solution 1: Update CSV product SKUs**
    - Export product list from your store
    - Compare SKUs with Judge.me CSV
    - Update Judge.me CSV to match current store SKUs
    - Re-import (faster than manual assignment)

    **Solution 2: Use product ID instead of SKU**
    - If SKUs changed but IDs stable
    - In import settings, select "Match by Product ID"
    - Re-import reviews

    **Solution 3: Manually assign unmatched reviews**
    - Go to Reviews → Unassigned
    - For each review, select correct product
    - Save
    - Works but time-consuming for many reviews

    **Solution 4: Create mapping file**
    - Old SKU → New SKU mapping
    - Upload to Yuko
    - Yuko applies mapping during import
    - Good for large migrations with many SKU changes

    **Prevent this:**
    - Before importing reviews, ensure products imported correctly to Yuko
    - Verify SKUs match between Judge.me and Yuko
    - Run test import (20 reviews) to verify matching
    - Fix issues before full import
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verified badges not showing" icon="badge-check">
    **Imported reviews missing verified purchase status**

    **Why this happens:**
    - Reviewer email doesn't match order email
    - Orders not imported to Yuko yet
    - Verification setting disabled during import
    - Judge.me verified status not in export

    **Solutions:**

    **Solution 1: Enable re-verification**
    - In import settings, enable "Re-verify against order history"
    - Re-import reviews (or run verification batch)
    - Yuko checks each email against orders
    - Applies verified badge if order found

    **Solution 2: Import orders first**
    - Ensure all orders imported to Yuko
    - Then re-verify reviews against orders
    - Verified badges appear

    **Solution 3: Trust Judge.me verified status**
    - If Judge.me CSV has "verified_buyer" column
    - Import that flag directly
    - Skip re-verification
    - Faster but less accurate

    **Expected verified rate:**
    - 60-80% of reviews should be verified
    - Lower if many guest checkouts
    - Or customers use different emails
    - Normal to have some unverified
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CSV upload errors" icon="file-excel">
    **CSV file won't upload or has errors**

    **Common CSV errors:**

    **Error: "Invalid CSV format"**
    - **Cause:** File not saved as CSV
    - **Fix:** In Excel, "Save As → CSV (Comma delimited)"

    **Error: "Required column missing"**
    - **Cause:** CSV missing product_id, rating, or review_text column
    - **Fix:** Add missing columns or use Yuko template

    **Error: "Character encoding issue"**
    - **Cause:** Special characters not supported
    - **Fix:** Save as "CSV UTF-8" (handles international characters)

    **Error: "File too large"**
    - **Cause:** CSV over 50MB
    - **Fix:** Split into multiple files, import separately

    **Error: "Invalid date format"**
    - **Cause:** Dates not in YYYY-MM-DD format
    - **Fix:** Reformat dates in Excel before import

    **How to fix CSV errors:**
    1. Download Yuko CSV template
    2. Copy your data into template
    3. Ensure all required fields filled
    4. Save as CSV UTF-8
    5. Try upload again
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Import taking too long" icon="clock">
    **Import stuck or running for hours**

    **Normal import times:**
    - 100 reviews: 2-5 minutes
    - 1,000 reviews: 10-20 minutes
    - 5,000 reviews: 30-60 minutes
    - 10,000+ reviews: 1-3 hours

    **If import exceeds these times:**

    **Cause 1: Many photos to download**
    - Photos are slowest part of import
    - 2-5 seconds per photo
    - 1,000 photos = 30-60 minutes minimum

    **Solution:** Be patient, photo downloads take time

    **Cause 2: Large photo files**
    - High-resolution photos slow download
    - Judge.me photos sometimes very large

    **Solution:** Let import complete, photos will compress

    **Cause 3: Server resource limits**
    - Hosting server timeout
    - Memory limits

    **Solution:** Contact support to run import server-side

    **Cause 4: Network issues**
    - Slow internet connection
    - Interrupted download

    **Solution:** Refresh page to see updated progress

    **Can you cancel and restart?**
    - Yes, can cancel any time
    - Reviews already imported remain
    - Re-import resumes where left off (skips duplicates)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Some reviews missing after import" icon="question">
    **Review count lower than Judge.me export**

    **Why reviews might be missing:**

    **Reason 1: Spam/pending excluded**
    - Import settings: "Skip spam and pending"
    - Intentionally not imported
    - Check import settings

    **Reason 2: Duplicate detection**
    - Reviews already in Yuko
    - Automatically skipped to prevent duplicates
    - Check import summary for duplicate count

    **Reason 3: Invalid data**
    - Some reviews missing required fields
    - Failed validation during import
    - Listed in "Failed imports" section

    **Reason 4: Product not found**
    - Reviews for discontinued products
    - No matching product in Yuko
    - Marked as "Unassigned"

    **How to find missing reviews:**

    **Check 1: Import summary**
    - View failed imports list
    - See reason for failure
    - Fix and re-import those reviews

    **Check 2: Unassigned reviews**
    - Go to Reviews → Unassigned
    - See reviews without product match
    - Manually assign or ignore

    **Check 3: Pending moderation**
    - Go to Reviews → Pending
    - Pending reviews from Judge.me
    - Approve to publish

    **Check 4: Compare counts**
    - Judge.me total: Count from export
    - Yuko total: Imported + Failed + Unassigned + Pending
    - Should add up to Judge.me total

    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will Judge.me reviews still show on my site after import?" icon="eye">
    **Yes - until you remove Judge.me widgets**

    **During migration:**
    - Judge.me reviews: Still displayed (Judge.me widgets)
    - Yuko reviews: Also displayed (Yuko widgets)
    - Both visible simultaneously (can be confusing)

    **After migration:**
    - Remove Judge.me widgets from theme
    - Only Yuko widgets remain
    - Reviews now from Yuko only

    **Recommended approach:**

    **Phase 1: Import to Yuko**
    - Import reviews
    - Install Yuko widgets (hidden or test mode)
    - Verify Yuko reviews displaying correctly
    - Judge.me still live on site

    **Phase 2: Test side-by-side**
    - Display both Judge.me and Yuko widgets
    - Compare side-by-side
    - Verify Yuko shows all reviews
    - Test for 1-2 days

    **Phase 3: Switch to Yuko only**
    - Remove Judge.me widgets from theme
    - Activate Yuko widgets fully
    - Judge.me reviews no longer visible
    - Only Yuko reviews show

    **Phase 4: Uninstall Judge.me**
    - Uninstall Judge.me app
    - Cancel subscription
    - Complete migration

    **Can reviews be on both platforms?**
    - Yes, during transition
    - Not recommended long-term (confusing for customers)
    - Choose one system for display
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import reviews from Judge.me AND other sources?" icon="layer-group">
    **Yes - combine reviews from multiple sources**

    **Common scenario:**
    - Judge.me reviews (most recent)
    - WooCommerce reviews (before Judge.me)
    - Want both in Yuko

    **How to import from multiple sources:**

    **Step 1: Import from each source separately**
    - Import WooCommerce reviews first
    - Then import Judge.me reviews
    - Yuko combines both automatically

    **Step 2: Duplicate detection**
    - Yuko checks for duplicates across imports
    - Same review won't appear twice
    - Matched by: Product + Reviewer email + Date

    **Step 3: Verify combined data**
    - Check total review count
    - Ensure no duplicates showing
    - Verify all sources represented

    **Example:**
    - WooCommerce: 500 reviews (2020-2022)
    - Judge.me: 1,000 reviews (2022-2024)
    - Yuko total: 1,500 reviews (combined)
    - 0 duplicates (different time periods)

    **Can I combine Judge.me + Loox + Yotpo?**
    - Yes, import from each separately
    - Yuko de-duplicates automatically
    - All reviews in one system

    **Order of imports:**
    - Doesn't matter which you import first
    - Recommend: Oldest platform first, newest last
    - Easier to track what came from where
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my Judge.me reviews after I cancel?" icon="trash">
    **Your reviews remain in Yuko - Judge.me data is separate**

    - Your Judge.me account deactivated
    - Reviews still in Judge.me database (they keep data)

    **In Yuko:**
    - Reviews you imported remain completely intact
    - Not affected by Judge.me cancellation
    - Independent copy in Yuko database
    - Continue displaying normally

    **Think of import as copying, not moving:**
    - Import copies reviews from Judge.me to Yuko
    - Original reviews remain in Judge.me

    **Can you get Judge.me reviews back after canceling?**
    - Contact Judge.me support
    - They may provide export of your data

    - Backup of all review data
    - Can import elsewhere if needed
    - Or reference for historical data

    <Warning>
    **Before canceling Judge.me:** Export and backup your reviews! Keep the CSV file permanently. Once you cancel Judge.me, you lose dashboard access and can't export reviews later.
