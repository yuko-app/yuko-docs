    **Navigation in Judge.me:**

    1. Log in to your Judge.me account
    2. Click "Settings" in left sidebar
    3. Scroll to "Export Reviews" section
    4. Click "Export to CSV"

    **Export options:**

    **What to include:**

    - ✅ All reviews (approved + pending)
    - ✅ Review photos and videos
    - ✅ Verified purchase status
    - ✅ Review dates
    - ✅ Reviewer information
    - ✅ Product mappings (SKU or ID)

    **Date range:**

    - All time (recommended)
    - Or specific date range if you only want recent reviews

    **Export file:**

    - Judge.me generates CSV file
    - Download to your computer
    - File typically named: `judgeme-reviews-export.csv`
    - Size depends on review count (1KB - 50MB)

    **What's included in CSV:**

    ```
    product_sku, review_title, review_body, rating, reviewer_name,
    reviewer_email, verified_buyer, review_date, photo_urls, video_urls
    ```

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Export all reviews, even pending ones. You can filter in Yuko after import. Better to have everything than discover you're missing reviews later.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 2: Prepare CSV for Yuko Import" icon="table">
    **Format Judge.me export for Yuko compatibility**

    **Open CSV file:**

    - Use Excel, Google Sheets, or text editor
    - Review column headers
    - Check data formatting

    **Required columns for Yuko:**

    - `product_id` or `product_sku` - Product identifier
    - `rating` - Star rating (1-5)
    - `review_text` - Review content
    - `reviewer_name` - Customer name
    - `date` - Review submission date (YYYY-MM-DD)

    **Optional but recommended:**

    - `email` - For verified purchase matching
    - `title` - Review headline
    - `verified` - true/false
    - `photo_urls` - Comma-separated photo URLs
    - `video_url` - Video URL

    **Common formatting issues to fix:**

    **Issue 1: Date format**

    - Judge.me exports: `12/15/2023` or `2023-12-15T10:30:00`
    - Yuko needs: `2023-12-15`
    - Fix: Use Excel date formatting or find/replace

    **Issue 2: Product SKU mismatch**

    - Judge.me SKU might not match your current store
    - Verify SKUs match Yuko product database
    - Update CSV if needed before import

    **Issue 3: Photo URLs**

    - Ensure photo URLs start with `http://` or `https://`
    - Multiple photos: Separate with pipe `|` character
    - Example: `https://cdn.judgeme.com/photo1.jpg|https://cdn.judgeme.com/photo2.jpg`

    **Issue 4: Special characters**

    - Ensure CSV is UTF-8 encoded
    - Handles international characters, emojis
    - Save as "CSV UTF-8" in Excel

    **Download Yuko CSV template:**

    - Yuko provides Judge.me import template
    - Shows exact column names needed
    - Includes sample data
    - Available in import wizard

    <Check>
      **Best practice:** Don't edit review content. Only fix formatting (dates, URLs). Keep reviews exactly as customers wrote them for authenticity.
    </Check>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Photos not importing from Judge.me" icon="image">
    **Review photos missing or failing to download**

    **Common causes:**

    - Photo URLs in CSV are broken/expired
    - Judge.me deleted photos after export
    - Network timeout during download
    - File format not supported

    **Solutions:**

    **Solution 1: Retry photo download**

    - In Yuko, go to Import History
    - Find Judge.me import
    - Click "Retry Failed Photos"
    - Yuko attempts re-download

    **Solution 2: Re-export from Judge.me with fresh URLs**

    - Some photo URLs expire quickly
    - Export reviews from Judge.me again
    - Get fresh photo URLs
    - Re-import (Yuko skips duplicate reviews, only imports photos)

    **Solution 3: Manually upload important photos**

    - Identify high-value reviews (5-star, detailed)
    - Download photos from Judge.me manually
    - Upload to those reviews in Yuko dashboard
    - Time-consuming but works for select reviews

    **Solution 4: Contact Judge.me support**

    - If many photos failing
    - Judge.me may have export issue
    - Request proper photo export
    - Or photo CDN URLs

    **Expected photo import rate:**

    - 90-95% success rate normal
    - 5-10% failure acceptable (often old/deleted photos)
    - If less than 80% success, investigate
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Product matching issues" icon="link-slash">
    **Reviews not matching to correct products**

    **Why this happens:**

    - Product SKU different in Judge.me vs your store
    - Product name changed
    - Product deleted/discontinued
    - SKU typo in CSV

    **Solutions:**

    **Solution 1: Update CSV product SKUs**

    - Export product list from your store
    - Compare SKUs with Judge.me CSV
    - Update Judge.me CSV to match current store SKUs
    - Re-import (faster than manual assignment)

    **Solution 2: Use product ID instead of SKU**

    - If SKUs changed but IDs stable
    - In import settings, select "Match by Product ID"
    - Re-import reviews

    **Solution 3: Manually assign unmatched reviews**

    - Go to Reviews → Unassigned
    - For each review, select correct product
    - Save
    - Works but time-consuming for many reviews

    **Solution 4: Create mapping file**

    - Old SKU → New SKU mapping
    - Upload to Yuko
    - Yuko applies mapping during import
    - Good for large migrations with many SKU changes

    **Prevent this:**

    - Before importing reviews, ensure products imported correctly to Yuko
    - Verify SKUs match between Judge.me and Yuko
    - Run test import (20 reviews) to verify matching
    - Fix issues before full import
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verified badges not showing" icon="badge-check">
    **Imported reviews missing verified purchase status**

    **Why this happens:**

    - Reviewer email doesn't match order email
    - Orders not imported to Yuko yet
    - Verification setting disabled during import
    - Judge.me verified status not in export

    **Solutions:**

    **Solution 1: Enable re-verification**

    - In import settings, enable "Re-verify against order history"
    - Re-import reviews (or run verification batch)
    - Yuko checks each email against orders
    - Applies verified badge if order found

    **Solution 2: Import orders first**

    - Ensure all orders imported to Yuko
    - Then re-verify reviews against orders
    - Verified badges appear

    **Solution 3: Trust Judge.me verified status**

    - If Judge.me CSV has "verified_buyer" column
    - Import that flag directly
    - Skip re-verification
    - Faster but less accurate

    **Expected verified rate:**

    - 60-80% of reviews should be verified
    - Lower if many guest checkouts
    - Or customers use different emails
    - Normal to have some unverified
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CSV upload errors" icon="file-excel">
    **CSV file won't upload or has errors**

    **Common CSV errors:**

    **Error: "Invalid CSV format"**

    - **Cause:** File not saved as CSV
    - **Fix:** In Excel, "Save As → CSV (Comma delimited)"

    **Error: "Required column missing"**

    - **Cause:** CSV missing product_id, rating, or review_text column
    - **Fix:** Add missing columns or use Yuko template

    **Error: "Character encoding issue"**

    - **Cause:** Special characters not supported
    - **Fix:** Save as "CSV UTF-8" (handles international characters)

    **Error: "File too large"**

    - **Cause:** CSV over 50MB
    - **Fix:** Split into multiple files, import separately

    **Error: "Invalid date format"**

    - **Cause:** Dates not in YYYY-MM-DD format
    - **Fix:** Reformat dates in Excel before import

    **How to fix CSV errors:**

    1. Download Yuko CSV template
    2. Copy your data into template
    3. Ensure all required fields filled
    4. Save as CSV UTF-8
    5. Try upload again
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Import taking too long" icon="clock">
    **Import stuck or running for hours**

    **Normal import times:**

    - 100 reviews: 2-5 minutes
    - 1,000 reviews: 10-20 minutes
    - 5,000 reviews: 30-60 minutes
    - 10,000+ reviews: 1-3 hours

    **If import exceeds these times:**

    **Cause 1: Many photos to download**

    - Photos are slowest part of import
    - 2-5 seconds per photo
    - 1,000 photos = 30-60 minutes minimum

    **Solution:** Be patient, photo downloads take time

    **Cause 2: Large photo files**

    - High-resolution photos slow download
    - Judge.me photos sometimes very large

    **Solution:** Let import complete, photos will compress

    **Cause 3: Server resource limits**

    - Hosting server timeout
    - Memory limits

    **Solution:** Contact support to run import server-side

    **Cause 4: Network issues**

    - Slow internet connection
    - Interrupted download

    **Solution:** Refresh page to see updated progress

    **Can you cancel and restart?**

    - Yes, can cancel any time
    - Reviews already imported remain
    - Re-import resumes where left off (skips duplicates)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Some reviews missing after import" icon="question">
    **Review count lower than Judge.me export**

    **Why reviews might be missing:**

    **Reason 1: Spam/pending excluded**

    - Import settings: "Skip spam and pending"
    - Intentionally not imported
    - Check import settings

    **Reason 2: Duplicate detection**

    - Reviews already in Yuko
    - Automatically skipped to prevent duplicates
    - Check import summary for duplicate count

    **Reason 3: Invalid data**

    - Some reviews missing required fields
    - Failed validation during import
    - Listed in "Failed imports" section

    **Reason 4: Product not found**

    - Reviews for discontinued products
    - No matching product in Yuko
    - Marked as "Unassigned"

    **How to find missing reviews:**

    **Check 1: Import summary**

    - View failed imports list
    - See reason for failure
    - Fix and re-import those reviews

    **Check 2: Unassigned reviews**

    - Go to Reviews → Unassigned
    - See reviews without product match
    - Manually assign or ignore

    **Check 3: Pending moderation**

    - Go to Reviews → Pending
    - Pending reviews from Judge.me
    - Approve to publish

    **Check 4: Compare counts**

    - Judge.me total: Count from export
    - Yuko total: Imported + Failed + Unassigned + Pending
    - Should add up to Judge.me total

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to keep Judge.me subscription during import?" icon="credit-card">
    **Yes - keep Judge.me active until migration complete**

    - Backup in case import fails

    **Recommended timeline:**

    **Day 1: Export and import**

    - Verify import successful

    **Week 1-2: Testing**

    - Keep both systems active

    - Technically yes, after export
    - **Not recommended** - keep as backup
    - Photos may break if Judge.me deleted too soon
    - Better safe than sorry

    <Tip>
      **Cost-saving tip:** Most Judge.me plans are monthly. Do export, import, and verification within one billing cycle. Cancel before next month to save cost while keeping backup active during migration.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will Judge.me reviews still show on my site after import?" icon="eye">
    **Yes - until you remove Judge.me widgets**

    **During migration:**

    - Judge.me reviews: Still displayed (Judge.me widgets)
    - Yuko reviews: Also displayed (Yuko widgets)
    - Both visible simultaneously (can be confusing)

    **After migration:**

    - Remove Judge.me widgets from theme
    - Only Yuko widgets remain
    - Reviews now from Yuko only

    **Recommended approach:**

    **Phase 1: Import to Yuko**

    - Import reviews
    - Install Yuko widgets (hidden or test mode)
    - Verify Yuko reviews displaying correctly
    - Judge.me still live on site

    **Phase 2: Test side-by-side**

    - Display both Judge.me and Yuko widgets
    - Compare side-by-side
    - Verify Yuko shows all reviews
    - Test for 1-2 days

    **Phase 3: Switch to Yuko only**

    - Remove Judge.me widgets from theme
    - Activate Yuko widgets fully
    - Judge.me reviews no longer visible
    - Only Yuko reviews show

    **Phase 4: Uninstall Judge.me**

    - Uninstall Judge.me app
    - Cancel subscription
    - Complete migration

    **Can reviews be on both platforms?**

    - Yes, during transition
    - Not recommended long-term (confusing for customers)
    - Choose one system for display
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I import reviews from Judge.me AND other sources?" icon="layer-group">
    **Yes - combine reviews from multiple sources**

    **Common scenario:**

    - Judge.me reviews (most recent)
    - WooCommerce reviews (before Judge.me)
    - Want both in Yuko

    **How to import from multiple sources:**

    **Step 1: Import from each source separately**

    - Import WooCommerce reviews first
    - Then import Judge.me reviews
    - Yuko combines both automatically

    **Step 2: Duplicate detection**

    - Yuko checks for duplicates across imports
    - Same review won't appear twice
    - Matched by: Product + Reviewer email + Date

    **Step 3: Verify combined data**

    - Check total review count
    - Ensure no duplicates showing
    - Verify all sources represented

    **Example:**

    - WooCommerce: 500 reviews (2020-2022)
    - Judge.me: 1,000 reviews (2022-2024)
    - Yuko total: 1,500 reviews (combined)
    - 0 duplicates (different time periods)

    **Can I combine Judge.me + Loox + Yotpo?**

    - Yes, import from each separately
    - Yuko de-duplicates automatically
    - All reviews in one system

    **Order of imports:**

    - Doesn't matter which you import first
    - Recommend: Oldest platform first, newest last
    - Easier to track what came from where
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to my Judge.me reviews after I cancel?" icon="trash">
    **Your reviews remain in Yuko - Judge.me data is separate**

    **After canceling Judge.me:**

    **In Judge.me:**

    - Your Judge.me account deactivated
    - Reviews still in Judge.me database (they keep data)
    - No longer accessible to you

    **In Yuko:**

    - Reviews you imported remain completely intact
    - Not affected by Judge.me cancellation
    - Independent copy in Yuko database
    - Continue displaying normally

    **Think of import as copying, not moving:**

    - Import copies reviews from Judge.me to Yuko
    - Original reviews remain in Judge.me
    - Your copy remains in Yuko
    - Two separate, independent systems

    **Can you get Judge.me reviews back after canceling?**

    - Contact Judge.me support
    - They may provide export of your data
    - Or reactivate account temporarily
    - Better to export before canceling

    **What if you need Judge.me reviews later?**

    - Keep Judge.me CSV export file forever
    - Backup of all review data
    - Can import elsewhere if needed
    - Or reference for historical data

    <Warning>
      **Before canceling Judge.me:** Export and backup your reviews! Keep the CSV file permanently. Once you cancel Judge.me, you lose dashboard access and can't export reviews later.
