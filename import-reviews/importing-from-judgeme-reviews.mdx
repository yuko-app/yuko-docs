    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 2: Prepare CSV for Yuko Import" icon="table">
    **Format Judge.me export for Yuko compatibility**

    **Open CSV file:**

    - Use Excel, Google Sheets, or text editor
    - Review column headers
    - Check data formatting

    **Required columns for Yuko:**

    - `product_id` or `product_sku` - Product identifier
    - `rating` - Star rating (1-5)
    - `review_text` - Review content
    - `reviewer_name` - Customer name
    - `date` - Review submission date (YYYY-MM-DD)

    **Optional but recommended:**

    - `email` - For verified purchase matching
    - `title` - Review headline
    - `verified` - true/false
    - `photo_urls` - Comma-separated photo URLs
    - `video_url` - Video URL

    **Common formatting issues to fix:**

    **Issue 1: Date format**

    - Judge.me exports: `12/15/2023` or `2023-12-15T10:30:00`
    - Yuko needs: `2023-12-15`
    - Fix: Use Excel date formatting or find/replace

    **Issue 2: Product SKU mismatch**

    - Judge.me SKU might not match your current store
    - Verify SKUs match Yuko product database
    - Update CSV if needed before import

    **Issue 3: Photo URLs**

    - Ensure photo URLs start with `http://` or `https://`
    - Multiple photos: Separate with pipe `|` character
    - Example: `https://cdn.judgeme.com/photo1.jpg|https://cdn.judgeme.com/photo2.jpg`

    **Issue 4: Special characters**

    - Ensure CSV is UTF-8 encoded
    - Handles international characters, emojis
    - Save as "CSV UTF-8" in Excel

    **Download Yuko CSV template:**

    - Yuko provides Judge.me import template
    - Shows exact column names needed
    - Includes sample data
    - Available in import wizard

    <Check>
      **Best practice:** Don't edit review content. Only fix formatting (dates, URLs). Keep reviews exactly as customers wrote them for authenticity.
