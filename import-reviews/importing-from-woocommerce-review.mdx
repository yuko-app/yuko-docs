    **Imported accurately:** ✅ Yes, 100% data fidelity
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reviewer Information">
    **Customer details and verification**

    **Reviewer name:**

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dates & Timestamps">
    **Review dates and timing**

    **Review submission date:**

    - Original date review was submitted
    - Preserved exactly (not changed to import date)
    - Important for authenticity and SEO

    **Review modification date:**

    - If review was edited in WooCommerce
    - Last modified timestamp
    - Tracked for audit purposes

    **Why dates matter:**

    - Shows review history over time
    - Looks natural (not all "today")
    - SEO value (review freshness and history)
    - Customer trust (spread over months/years)

    **Example:**

    - Review submitted: March 15, 2023
    - Imported to Yuko: December 1, 2024
    - Displays on Yuko: "Reviewed on March 15, 2023" ✅

    **Imported accurately:** ✅ Yes, original dates preserved
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Product Mapping">
    **Which products reviews belong to**

    **Product matching:**

    - WooCommerce review linked to post ID
    - Yuko finds matching product automatically
    - Based on product ID, SKU, or slug
    - 99% automatic match rate

    **How matching works:**

    1. Yuko reads which WooCommerce product review belongs to
    2. Searches for same product in Yuko database
    3. Matches by product ID (most reliable)
    4. Falls back to SKU matching if ID not found
    5. Assigns review to matched product

    **Successful match:**

    - Review appears on correct product page
    - Review count updates for product
    - Average rating recalculated

    **No match found (rare):**

    - Review marked as "Unassigned"
    - Can manually assign to product in Yuko
    - Or ignore if product discontinued

    **Product variations:**

    - Reviews for product variations (size, color) import to parent product
    - Shown for all variations
    - Variation info in review text (if customer mentioned)

    **Imported accurately:** ✅ Yes, automatic matching very reliable
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="What Doesn't Import">
    **Limitations and exclusions**

    **Photos and videos:**

    - ❌ Native WooCommerce doesn't support review photos
    - ❌ If using plugin for photos, may not import automatically
    - ✅ Can manually add photos to imported reviews after
    - ✅ Some plugin integrations supported (check compatibility)

    **Custom fields:**

    - ❌ Custom meta fields from plugins may not import
    - ❌ Plugin-specific data (badges, custom ratings)
    - ✅ Standard WooCommerce fields always import

    **Review replies:**

    - ❌ Store owner replies to reviews (not standard in WooCommerce)
    - ❌ If using plugin for replies, may not import
    - ✅ Can add replies in Yuko after import

    **Helpful votes:**

    - ❌ "Was this review helpful?" vote counts
    - ❌ Not standard in WooCommerce, plugin-dependent
    - Starts fresh in Yuko

    **Review reports:**

    - ❌ Customer reports of inappropriate reviews
    - Doesn't transfer from WooCommerce
    - Use Yuko moderation tools after import

    **Why these don't import:**

    - Not standard WooCommerce features
    - Stored in plugin-specific database tables
    - Would require custom integration for each plugin
    - Core review data (text, rating, reviewer, date) is priority
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## After Import: Next Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Imported Reviews" icon="circle-check">
    Check that reviews imported correctly.

    **Verification checklist:**

    1. Total count: Reviews → Dashboard shows count matching WooCommerce
    2. Random sampling: Check 10-20 random product pages
    3. Verified badges: Ensure verified purchases show badge
    4. Dates: Confirm original dates preserved (not all "today")
    5. Product assignment: Reviews on correct products

    **Time:** 15-30 minutes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Unassigned Reviews" icon="link-slash">
    Manually assign reviews that couldn't auto-match.

    **If you have unassigned reviews:**

    1. Go to Reviews → Unassigned Reviews
    2. See list of reviews without product match
    3. For each review, manually select correct product
    4. Save assignment

    **Common causes:**

    - Product discontinued in Yuko
    - Product ID/SKU changed
    - Product imported after reviews

    **Time:** 5-10 minutes (if any unassigned)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Moderate Pending Reviews" icon="hourglass">
    Review and publish pending reviews from WooCommerce.

    **If you have pending reviews:**

    1. Go to Reviews → Pending
    2. Review each pending review
    3. Approve legitimate reviews
    4. Reject spam or inappropriate content

    **Why pending:**

    - Were awaiting moderation in WooCommerce
    - Status preserved during import
    - You can approve/reject in Yuko now

    **Time:** 10-30 minutes (depending on pending count)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Review Display Widgets" icon="browser">
    Install Yuko widgets to show imported reviews on your store.

    **Required for reviews to appear:**

    1. Go to Yuko Dashboard → Widgets
    2. Install Product Review Widget
    3. Install Star Rating Widget
    4. Place widgets on product pages
    5. Verify reviews displaying

    **Imported reviews won't show until widgets installed**

    → [Widget installation guide](/display-reviews/introduction-to-widgets)

    **Time:** 20-30 minutes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove WooCommerce Native Reviews (Optional)" icon="trash">
    Disable WooCommerce reviews once Yuko is live.

    **Before disabling:**

    - ✅ Verify all reviews imported successfully
    - ✅ Test Yuko widget display on product pages
    - ✅ Keep WooCommerce reviews active for 1-2 weeks (backup)

    **How to disable WooCommerce reviews:**

    1. WooCommerce → Settings → Products
    2. Uncheck "Enable product reviews"
    3. Save changes
    4. WooCommerce review form hidden on product pages
    5. Yuko widgets now primary review system

    **Time:** 5 minutes

    <Warning>
      **Don't rush:** Keep WooCommerce reviews enabled for 1-2 weeks after import to ensure Yuko is working perfectly. Monitor conversion rates and review submission before fully disabling.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Import stuck or not completing" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Import progress bar frozen or taking too long**

    **Possible causes:**

    - Large review count (10,000+ reviews)
    - Server resource limits (PHP timeout, memory limit)
    - Connection timeout between Yuko and WooCommerce
    - Database query performance

    **Solutions:**

    **Solution 1: Wait it out**

    - Large imports (5,000+ reviews) can take 30-60 minutes
    - Import continues server-side even if progress bar seems stuck
    - Refresh page to see updated progress
    - Don't cancel unless truly stuck for hours

    **Solution 2: Import in batches**

    - Instead of "Import all reviews"
    - Select "Import 1,000 reviews at a time"
    - Run multiple import batches
    - Yuko auto-skips duplicates

    **Solution 3: Increase server limits**

    - Contact your hosting provider
    - Request increased PHP memory limit (256MB minimum)
    - Request increased max execution time (300 seconds minimum)
    - Try import again

    **Solution 4: Contact Yuko support**

    - If import consistently failing
    - Provide: Review count, error messages, server environment
    - Support can manually process large imports
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verified Purchase badges not showing" icon="badge-check">
    **Imported reviews missing verified purchase status**

    **Why this happens:**

    - Email in review doesn't match email in order
    - Customer used different email for review vs purchase
    - Order history not synced to Yuko yet
    - Verification setting disabled

    **Solutions:**

    **Solution 1: Enable re-verification**

    - In import settings, enable "Re-verify against order history"
    - Yuko checks each reviewer email against order database
    - Applies verified badge if order found
    - More accurate than importing WooCommerce verified status directly

    **Solution 2: Sync order history first**

    - Ensure WooCommerce orders imported to Yuko
    - Go to Integrations → WooCommerce → Sync Orders
    - Then re-import reviews (or run verification batch)
    - Verified badges will appear

    **Solution 3: Manually verify high-value reviews**

    - For important reviews (5-star with photos)
    - Manually check if customer ordered that product
    - Mark as "Verified Purchase" in Yuko dashboard

    **Expected verified rate:**

    - 60-80% of reviews should be verified
    - Guest checkouts often lack matching email
    - Some customers use different emails
    - Normal to have some unverified reviews
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reviews imported to wrong products" icon="link-slash">
    **Reviews showing on incorrect product pages**

    **Why this happens:**

    - Product ID mismatch between WooCommerce and Yuko
    - Product SKU changed during migration
    - Variation reviews assigned to parent
    - Product duplicates in Yuko

    **Solutions:**

    **Solution 1: Check product ID mapping**

    - Export product list from WooCommerce
    - Export product list from Yuko
    - Compare IDs - should match exactly
    - If different, update Yuko product IDs to match WooCommerce

    **Solution 2: Manually reassign mismatched reviews**

    - Find reviews on wrong products
    - Edit review in Yuko dashboard
    - Change assigned product to correct one
    - Save

    **Solution 3: Delete and re-import**

    - If many reviews mismatched
    - Delete all imported reviews (backup first)
    - Fix product ID mismatches
    - Re-import reviews

    **Prevent this:**

    - Before importing reviews, ensure products imported correctly
    - Verify product IDs match between WooCommerce and Yuko
    - Run test import (20 reviews) to verify matching
    - Check test results before full import
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review dates showing as today" icon="calendar">
    **All imported reviews have today's date instead of original date**

    **Why this happens:**

    - Date preservation setting disabled
    - Database date field not read correctly
    - Import bug (rare)

    **Solutions:**

    **Solution 1: Check import settings**

    - In import wizard, verify "Preserve original review dates" is enabled
    - Should be enabled by default
    - If disabled, re-import with setting enabled

    **Solution 2: Contact support (bug)**

    - If date preservation enabled but still not working
    - This is a bug - report to Yuko support
    - Provide: Screenshot of import settings, sample affected reviews
    - Support can run corrective script to restore original dates

    **Why dates matter:**

    - All reviews dated "today" looks suspicious to customers
    - Loses SEO value of historical reviews
    - Appears inauthentic
    - Should always preserve original dates
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Import fails with error message" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Import stops with error notification**

    **Common error messages and fixes:**

    **Error: "Cannot connect to WooCommerce"**

    - **Cause:** WooCommerce API not accessible
    - **Fix:** Check WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced → REST API enabled
    - **Fix:** Verify Yuko API key has correct permissions

    **Error: "Database query timeout"**

    - **Cause:** Too many reviews to process at once
    - **Fix:** Import in smaller batches (1,000 at a time)
    - **Fix:** Contact hosting to increase database query timeout

    **Error:** "Product not found for review ID 12345"\*\*

    - **Cause:** Review references product that doesn't exist in Yuko
    - **Fix:** Import will continue, review marked as "Unassigned"
    - **Fix:** Manually assign to correct product after import

    **Error: "Memory limit exceeded"**

    - **Cause:** PHP memory limit too low for large import
    - **Fix:** Contact hosting to increase memory_limit to 256MB+
    - **Fix:** Or import in smaller batches

    **Error: "Duplicate review detected"**

    - **Not an error:** Yuko auto-skips duplicates
    - **Cause:** Review already imported previously
    - **Fix:** No action needed, import continues

    **If error persists:**

    - Screenshot error message
    - Note: Review count, WooCommerce version, PHP version
    - Contact Yuko support with details
    - Support can troubleshoot specific issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Photos didn't import from WooCommerce" icon="image">
    **Review photos missing after import**

    **Why this happens:**

    - Native WooCommerce doesn't support review photos
    - Using plugin for photos (not standard feature)
    - Plugin stores photos differently
    - Automatic import doesn't support plugin's format

    **Solutions:**

    **Solution 1: Check plugin compatibility**

    - What plugin are you using for WooCommerce review photos?
    - Supported: [List of plugins Yuko integrates with]
    - If your plugin supported, enable plugin import in settings
    - If not supported, use Solution 2 or 3

    **Solution 2: Manually add photos to important reviews**

    - Identify 20-30 highest-value reviews (5-star, detailed)
    - Download photos from WooCommerce
    - Upload to those reviews in Yuko dashboard
    - Time-consuming but works for select reviews

    **Solution 3: Request photo URLs and re-import**

    - Export review photos from WooCommerce plugin
    - Get public URLs for each photo
    - Create CSV with review ID + photo URL
    - Import photo URLs to Yuko
    - Yuko attaches photos to existing reviews

    **Solution 4: Start collecting new photo reviews**

    - Accept that old review photos won't transfer
    - Focus on collecting new photo reviews in Yuko
    - Offer incentive (10% off) for customers to add photos
    - Build photo review library over time

    **Reality check:**

    - Photo import is challenging across platforms
    - Text reviews are most important (import those first)
    - Photos are bonus - don't let missing photos block migration
    - Start fresh with Yuko photo review collection

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will import create duplicate reviews?" icon="clone">
    **No - Yuko automatically detects and skips duplicates**

    **How duplicate detection works:**

    - Yuko checks if review already exists in database
    - Matches by: Product ID + Reviewer email + Review date
    - If match found: Skips import (doesn't create duplicate)
    - If no match: Imports as new review

    **What this means:**

    - Safe to run import multiple times
    - Won't double-show same reviews
    - If import fails mid-way, can retry without duplicates
    - Can re-import after adding new WooCommerce reviews

    **Import summary shows:**

    ```
    Duplicates skipped: 13 reviews
    ```

    **Why duplicates might exist:**

    - Previously imported reviews from WooCommerce
    - Ran test import, then full import
    - Re-imported after fixing issues

    **What happens to duplicates:**

    - Not imported again
    - Original review remains unchanged
    - Count shown in import summary
    - Can safely ignore

    <Check>
      **Best practice:** If you previously imported WooCommerce reviews to Yuko, running import again is safe. Yuko skips duplicates and imports only new reviews added since last import.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I re-import if I made a mistake?" icon="arrow-rotate-right">
    **Yes - delete imported reviews and re-import**

    **When to re-import:**

    - Forgot to enable verified purchase verification
    - Product IDs were wrong (reviews on wrong products)
    - Imported spam/pending reviews accidentally
    - Want to update import settings

    **How to re-import:**

    **Step 1: Delete previous import**

    1. Go to Reviews → Manage Reviews
    2. Filter by "Source: WooCommerce"
    3. Select all imported reviews
    4. Bulk action: Delete
    5. Confirm deletion

    **Step 2: Run import again**

    1. Go to Reviews → Import → WooCommerce
    2. Adjust import settings (fix previous mistake)
    3. Run import again
    4. Reviews import fresh with new settings

    **What gets deleted:**

    - Only imported reviews
    - Any new reviews collected in Yuko remain untouched
    - WooCommerce reviews unchanged (still in WooCommerce)

    **What to watch out for:**

    - If you replied to any imported reviews in Yuko, those replies deleted too
    - If you edited any imported reviews, edits lost
    - Better to re-import sooner than later (before too many changes)

    <Warning>
      **Before deleting:** Export your Yuko reviews as backup first. Just in case you need to reference deleted data later.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does import affect my WooCommerce reviews?" icon="question">
    **No - WooCommerce reviews remain completely unchanged**

    **What import does:**

    - **Reads** WooCommerce review data
    - **Copies** to Yuko database
    - **Does not modify** WooCommerce

    **Your WooCommerce reviews:**

    - Still exist in WooCommerce
    - Still visible (until you disable WooCommerce reviews)
    - Can still be edited in WooCommerce
    - Not deleted or changed during import

    **Think of import as copying, not moving:**

    - Like copying files from one folder to another
    - Original files remain intact
    - Copy independent of original

    **After import:**

    - WooCommerce reviews: Still in WooCommerce database
    - Yuko reviews: Copy in Yuko database
    - Two separate systems with same review data
    - You choose which to display on storefront

    **Recommended approach:**

    1. Import WooCommerce reviews to Yuko
    2. Verify Yuko working correctly
    3. Test for 1-2 weeks
    4. Disable WooCommerce reviews (hide from display)
    5. Use Yuko as primary review system
    6. Keep WooCommerce reviews in database as backup

    **Can you delete WooCommerce reviews after import?**

    - Yes, technically possible
    - **Not recommended** - keep as backup
    - Just disable display, don't delete data
    - Allows rollback if needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often should I run the import?" icon="clock">
    **One-time import vs regular syncing**

    **Most common: One-time migration**

    - Import WooCommerce reviews once
    - Switch to Yuko for all future reviews
    - Disable WooCommerce review collection
    - Don't need to import again

    **Alternative: Regular syncing**

    - Keep WooCommerce reviews enabled
    - Import new WooCommerce reviews to Yuko periodically
    - Useful if collecting reviews via both systems
    - Run import weekly or monthly

    **Why one-time is recommended:**

    - Cleaner separation of systems
    - Avoid confusion (which system is primary?)
    - Yuko has better features than WooCommerce
    - Simpler management

    **When to do regular syncing:**

    - Collecting reviews on multiple platforms temporarily
    - Migrating gradually (some products WooCommerce, some Yuko)
    - Want backup of reviews in both systems
    - Using WooCommerce for internal reviews, Yuko for display

    **How to sync regularly:**

    - Run import weekly/monthly
    - Yuko auto-skips duplicates
    - Only new reviews added to Yuko
    - Takes seconds (only imports new reviews)

    <Tip>
      **Recommended:** One-time import → Switch to Yuko → Disable WooCommerce reviews. This is the cleanest migration path. Regular syncing adds complexity without much benefit.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I add new products after import?" icon="plus">
    **Import only imports reviews for existing products**

    **Scenario:**

    1. You import WooCommerce reviews to Yuko (1,000 products)
    2. Reviews import successfully
    3. You add 100 new products to store
    4. Those 100 products have WooCommerce reviews too
    5. New product reviews not imported automatically

    **Solution: Run partial re-import**

    - Go to Import → WooCommerce
    - Select "Import from specific products only"
    - Choose the 100 new products
    - Import reviews for those products only
    - Existing reviews skipped (duplicates)

    **Or: Run full import again**

    - Safe to run full import again
    - Yuko skips all previously imported reviews
    - Imports only new product reviews
    - Fast (most reviews skipped as duplicates)

    **Prevention:**

    - Import products before importing reviews
    - Ensure all products in Yuko first
    - Then import reviews
    - Reviews auto-match to products

    **What if product added but has no reviews yet?**

    - No action needed
    - When reviews come in WooCommerce, import later
    - Or just collect new reviews in Yuko (don't import)

## Need Help?

<NeedHelp />

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Before importing, verify all your WooCommerce products are already in Yuko. This ensures perfect product matching. Then run a test import with 20 reviews to verify everything works before importing your full review database.
