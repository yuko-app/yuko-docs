      ![conn.png](/images/conn.png)

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Test WooCommerce connection by importing 1-2 reviews first (you'll do this in Step 4). If connection works for test import, it will work for full import.

## After Import: Next Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Imported Reviews" icon="circle-check">
    Check that reviews imported correctly.

    **Verification checklist:**

    1. Total count: Reviews → Dashboard shows count matching WooCommerce
    2. Random sampling: Check 10-20 random product pages
    3. Verified badges: Ensure verified purchases show badge
    4. Dates: Confirm original dates preserved (not all "today")
    5. Product assignment: Reviews on correct products

    **Time:** 15-30 minutes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Moderate Pending Reviews" icon="hourglass">
    Review and publish pending reviews from WooCommerce.

    **If you have pending reviews:**

    1. Go to Reviews → Pending
    2. Review each pending review
    3. Approve legitimate reviews
    4. Reject spam or inappropriate content

    **Why pending:**

    - Were awaiting moderation in WooCommerce
    - Status preserved during import
    - You can approve/reject in Yuko now

    **Time:** 10-30 minutes (depending on pending count)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Review Display Widgets" icon="browser">
    Install Yuko widgets to show imported reviews on your store.

    **Required for reviews to appear:**

    1. Go to Yuko Dashboard → Widgets
    2. Install Product Review Widget
    3. Install Star Rating Widget
    4. Place widgets on product pages
    5. Verify reviews displaying

    **Imported reviews won't show until widgets installed**

    → [Widget installation guide](/display-reviews/introduction-to-widgets)

    **Time:** 20-30 minutes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove WooCommerce Native Reviews (Optional)" icon="trash">
    Disable WooCommerce reviews once Yuko is live. If you’re using **YUKO as your primary review system**, we recommend disabling WooCommerce’s native reviews to avoid duplicate forms and inconsistent styling.

    **Before disabling:**

    - ✅ Verify all reviews imported successfully
    - ✅ Test Yuko widget display on product pages
    - ✅ Keep WooCommerce reviews active for 1-2 weeks (backup)

    **How to disable WooCommerce reviews:**

    1. WooCommerce → Settings → Products
    2. Uncheck "Enable product reviews"
    3. Save changes
    4. WooCommerce review form hidden on product pages
    5. Yuko widgets now primary review system

    **Time:** 5 minutes

    <Warning>
      **Don't rush:** Keep WooCommerce reviews enabled for 1-2 weeks after import to ensure Yuko is working perfectly. Monitor conversion rates and review submission before fully disabling.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will import create duplicate reviews?" icon="clone">
    **No - Yuko automatically detects and skips duplicates**

    **How duplicate detection works:**

    - Yuko checks if review already exists in database
    - Matches by: Product ID + Reviewer email + Review date
    - If match found: Skips import (doesn't create duplicate)
    - If no match: Imports as new review

    **What this means:**

    - Safe to run import multiple times
    - Won't double-show same reviews
    - If import fails mid-way, can retry without duplicates
    - Can re-import after adding new WooCommerce reviews

    **Import summary shows:**

    ```
    Duplicates skipped: 13 reviews
    ```

    **Why duplicates might exist:**

    - Previously imported reviews from WooCommerce
    - Ran test import, then full import
    - Re-imported after fixing issues

    **What happens to duplicates:**

    - Not imported again
    - Original review remains unchanged
    - Count shown in import summary
    - Can safely ignore

    <Check>
      **Best practice:** If you previously imported WooCommerce reviews to Yuko, running import again is safe. Yuko skips duplicates and imports only new reviews added since last import.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I re-import if I made a mistake?" icon="arrow-rotate-right">
    **Yes - delete imported reviews and re-import**

    **When to re-import:**

    - Forgot to enable verified purchase verification
    - Product IDs were wrong (reviews on wrong products)
    - Imported spam/pending reviews accidentally
    - Want to update import settings

    **How to re-import:**

    **Step 1: Delete previous import**

    1. Go to Reviews → Manage Reviews
    2. Filter by "Source: WooCommerce"
    3. Select all imported reviews
    4. Bulk action: Delete
    5. Confirm deletion

    **Step 2: Run import again**

    1. Go to Reviews → Import → WooCommerce
    2. Adjust import settings (fix previous mistake)
    3. Run import again
    4. Reviews import fresh with new settings

    **What gets deleted:**

    - Only imported reviews
    - Any new reviews collected in Yuko remain untouched
    - WooCommerce reviews unchanged (still in WooCommerce)

    **What to watch out for:**

    - If you replied to any imported reviews in Yuko, those replies deleted too
    - If you edited any imported reviews, edits lost
    - Better to re-import sooner than later (before too many changes)

    <Warning>
      **Before deleting:** Export your Yuko reviews as backup first. Just in case you need to reference deleted data later.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does import affect my WooCommerce reviews?" icon="question">
    **No - WooCommerce reviews remain completely unchanged**

    **What import does:**

    - **Reads** WooCommerce review data
    - **Copies** to Yuko database
    - **Does not modify** WooCommerce

    **Your WooCommerce reviews:**

    - Still exist in WooCommerce
    - Still visible (until you disable WooCommerce reviews)
    - Can still be edited in WooCommerce
    - Not deleted or changed during import

    **Think of import as copying, not moving:**

    - Like copying files from one folder to another
    - Original files remain intact
    - Copy independent of original

    **After import:**

    - WooCommerce reviews: Still in WooCommerce database
    - Yuko reviews: Copy in Yuko database
    - Two separate systems with same review data
    - You choose which to display on storefront

    **Recommended approach:**

    1. Import WooCommerce reviews to Yuko
    2. Verify Yuko working correctly
    3. Test for 1-2 weeks
    4. Disable WooCommerce reviews (hide from display)
    5. Use Yuko as primary review system
    6. Keep WooCommerce reviews in database as backup

    **Can you delete WooCommerce reviews after import?**

    - Yes, technically possible
    - **Not recommended** - keep as backup
    - Just disable display, don't delete data
    - Allows rollback if needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often should I run the import?" icon="clock">
    **One-time import vs regular syncing**

    **Most common: One-time migration**

    - Import WooCommerce reviews once
    - Switch to Yuko for all future reviews
    - Disable WooCommerce review collection
    - Don't need to import again

    **Alternative: Regular syncing**

    - Keep WooCommerce reviews enabled
    - Import new WooCommerce reviews to Yuko periodically
    - Useful if collecting reviews via both systems
    - Run import weekly or monthly

    **Why one-time is recommended:**

    - Cleaner separation of systems
    - Avoid confusion (which system is primary?)
    - Yuko has better features than WooCommerce
    - Simpler management

    **When to do regular syncing:**

    - Collecting reviews on multiple platforms temporarily
    - Migrating gradually (some products WooCommerce, some Yuko)
    - Want backup of reviews in both systems
    - Using WooCommerce for internal reviews, Yuko for display

    **How to sync regularly:**

    - Run import weekly/monthly
    - Yuko auto-skips duplicates
    - Only new reviews added to Yuko
    - Takes seconds (only imports new reviews)

    <Tip>
      **Recommended:** One-time import → Switch to Yuko → Disable WooCommerce reviews. This is the cleanest migration path. Regular syncing adds complexity without much benefit.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I add new products after import?" icon="plus">
    **Import only imports reviews for existing products**

    **Scenario:**

    1. You import WooCommerce reviews to Yuko (1,000 products)
    2. Reviews import successfully
    3. You add 100 new products to store
    4. Those 100 products have WooCommerce reviews too
    5. New product reviews not imported automatically

    **Solution: Run partial re-import**

    - Go to Import → WooCommerce
    - Select "Import from specific products only"
    - Choose the 100 new products
    - Import reviews for those products only
    - Existing reviews skipped (duplicates)

    **Or: Run full import again**

    - Safe to run full import again
    - Yuko skips all previously imported reviews
    - Imports only new product reviews
    - Fast (most reviews skipped as duplicates)

    **Prevention:**

    - Import products before importing reviews
    - Ensure all products in Yuko first
    - Then import reviews
    - Reviews auto-match to products

    **What if product added but has no reviews yet?**

    - No action needed
    - When reviews come in WooCommerce, import later
    - Or just collect new reviews in Yuko (don't import)

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Before importing, verify all your WooCommerce products are already in Yuko. This ensures perfect product matching. Then run a test import with 20 reviews to verify everything works before importing your full review database.
