## Understanding Verified Buyer Badges

Verified badges prove that reviews come from customers who actually purchased the product through your store.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Verified Reviews" icon="circle-check">
    **From actual purchasers**

    - Customer ordered product through your store
    - Order confirmed in WooCommerce/Shopify
    - Purchase tied to review in Yuko database
    - Automatic or manual verification available
    - Displays "Verified Buyer" or "Verified Purchase" badge

    **Trust level:** High - shoppers trust these 3-5x more
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unverified Reviews" icon="circle-question">
    **No purchase record found**

    - Review submitted without order connection
    - Customer may have purchased in-store or elsewhere
    - Imported reviews without order data
    - Manual review submissions
    - No badge displayed (or "Unverified" label optional)

    **Trust level:** Lower - shoppers often question authenticity
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Automatic verification:** When connected to WooCommerce or Shopify, Yuko automatically verifies reviews from customers who purchased through your online store.
</Note>

**How Verified Badges Work:**\
\
Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Manage Reviews -\> Add Verified Badge**

![vb.png](/images/vb.png)

\
\
A review earns a **Verified Buyer** badge when:

- The reviewer purchased the product from your connected Shopify or WooCommerce store
- The review is successfully matched to a real order in Yuko
- The purchase data (email, order ID, product) aligns with the review

Once enabled, Yuko **automatically applies** the Verified Buyer badge to all qualifying reviews.

    - Choose how reviewer names appear publicly on all widgets.\
      Options include:
      - **Full Name** – Ideal for transparency and trust
      - **First Name Only** – A balance of privacy and authenticity

    **Settings:** Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Display → Reviewer Name Format**

  <Accordion title="Review Date Format" icon="calendar">
    Select how review timestamps are displayed.\
    Examples:

    - **YYYY-MM-DD**
    - **DD/MM/YYYY**
    - **Month DD, YYYY**

    This helps maintain consistency with your store’s regional format or brand style.\
    \
    **Settings:** Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Display → Date Format**

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Use relative dates ("2 weeks ago") for reviews less than 60 days old, then switch to full dates for older reviews. This keeps recent activity feeling fresh while maintaining clarity for historical reviews.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Product Sorting in Review Requests & Widgets" icon="list-ol">
    Control how products are ordered when customers receive review request emails or when they see review widgets.\
    Sorting options include:

    - **Most Expensive First** – Useful for premium product lines
    - **Cheapest First** – Highlights accessible products
    - **Random Order** – Provides a balanced, unbiased view

    Improves customer review completion rates and boosts product visibility.

    **Settings:** Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Review Requests → Product Display Order**

    <Check>
      **Recommended:** "Recently purchased" order yields 35-40% higher review submission rates than random order.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Number of Review Inputs (Email Review Request Limit)" icon="hashtag">
    Set how many products appear in each review request email.
