## Understanding Verified Buyer Badges

Verified badges prove that reviews come from customers who actually purchased the product through your store.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Verified Reviews" icon="circle-check">
    **From actual purchasers**

    - Customer ordered product through your store
    - Order confirmed in WooCommerce/Shopify
    - Purchase tied to review in Yuko database
    - Automatic or manual verification available
    - Displays "Verified Buyer" or "Verified Purchase" badge

    **Trust level:** High - shoppers trust these 3-5x more
  </Card>

  <Card title="Unverified Reviews" icon="circle-question">
    **No purchase record found**

    - Review submitted without order connection
    - Customer may have purchased in-store or elsewhere
    - Imported reviews without order data
    - Manual review submissions
    - No badge displayed (or "Unverified" label optional)

    **Trust level:** Lower - shoppers often question authenticity
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Automatic verification:** When connected to WooCommerce or Shopify, Yuko automatically verifies reviews from customers who purchased through your online store.
</Note>

## How Verified Badges Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Store" icon="link">
    Link your ecommerce platform to enable automatic verification.

    **Supported platforms:**
    - WooCommerce (WordPress)
    - Shopify
    - Shopify Plus

    **What Yuko syncs:**
    - Customer email addresses
    - Order numbers and dates
    - Products purchased
    - Order status (completed, refunded, etc.)

    **Setup:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Integrations** → Connect store

    Once connected, all new reviews from verified purchasers automatically receive badges.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic Badge Assignment" icon="robot">
    Yuko matches reviews to orders automatically.

    **Verification process:**
    1. Customer submits review
    2. Yuko checks customer email against order database
    3. Confirms product in customer's order history
    4. Checks order was completed (not cancelled/refunded)
    5. Automatically adds "Verified Buyer" badge if all checks pass

    **Verification criteria:**
    - Email match: Review email = Order email
    - Product match: Reviewed product in order
    - Order status: Completed or fulfilled
    - Time window: Review within 365 days of purchase (default)

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Adjust verification time window in **Settings → Reviews → Verification Rules** if you sell products with longer usage cycles (e.g., appliances, furniture).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manual Badge Assignment" icon="hand">
    Add verified badges manually for special cases.

    **When to use manual verification:**
    - In-store purchases (POS not connected to Yuko)
    - Wholesale or B2B orders
    - Imported reviews with order records
    - Reviews from previous system migrations
    - Gift recipients who reviewed product

    **How to manually verify:**
    1. Navigate to **Manage Reviews**
    2. Find the review to verify
    3. Click the **ellipsis icon (⋮)** on the right
    4. Select **Add Verified Badge** from dropdown
    5. Badge appears instantly

    ![Addvb Pn](/images/addvb.png)

    **Remove manual badges:**
    - Follow same steps but select **Remove Verified Badge**
    - Use if verification was added in error
  </Step>

  <Step title="Badge Display on Widgets" icon="display">
    Verified badges appear across all review displays.

    **Badge shows up on:**
    - Review widgets (grid, carousel, list)
    - Product page reviews section
    - Homepage review showcases
    - All-reviews page
    - Review request emails (shows verified status)

    **Badge appearance:**
    - "Verified Buyer" or "Verified Purchase" text
    - Checkmark icon (✓) next to reviewer name
    - Optional color highlighting (green badge)
    - Customizable in widget settings

    **Customize badge text:**
    Settings → **Reviews → Display** → Verified Badge Label

    **Navigation:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Verification Rules**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verification for Imported Reviews" icon="file-import">
    **Verify reviews migrated from other platforms**

    **When importing reviews:**

    **From WooCommerce native reviews:**
    - Yuko automatically preserves verification status
    - Reviews tied to orders remain verified
    - No manual work needed

    **From Judge.me, Loox, Stamped:**
    - Import includes order IDs (if available in export)
    - Yuko matches order IDs to current store orders
    - Auto-verifies matches found

    **From CSV imports:**
    - Include "order_id" or "order_number" column
    - Yuko attempts to match against store orders
    - Unmatched reviews remain unverified

    **Manual verification post-import:**
    1. Go to **Manage Reviews**
    2. Filter by "Unverified"
    3. Cross-reference with order history
    4. Manually add badges where appropriate

    <Info>
    **Import tip:** When exporting from previous review platform, include order numbers/IDs in CSV to maximize automatic verification during import.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verification for Gift Recipients" icon="gift">
    **Handle reviews from gift recipients**

    **The gift purchase scenario:**
    - Buyer A purchases product as gift for Recipient B
    - Recipient B receives product and wants to review
    - Recipient B's email doesn't match order email (Buyer A's email)
    - Review cannot auto-verify

    **Solutions:**

    **Option 1: Manual verification** (recommended)
    - Review is submitted by gift recipient
    - Store owner verifies through order notes or customer service records
    - Manually adds verified badge in Yuko

    **Option 2: Gift recipient tracking**
    - Enable "Gift recipient email" field during checkout
    - Store captures both buyer and recipient emails
    - Yuko verifies against both emails
    - Setup: WooCommerce/Shopify checkout customization required

    **Option 3: Order number verification**
    - Gift recipient enters order number when reviewing
    - Yuko verifies product in that order
    - Auto-adds verified badge
    - Enable in: **Settings → Reviews → Gift Order Verification**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unverified Review Handling" icon="question">
    **Decide how to treat reviews without purchase proof**

    **Display options for unverified reviews:**

    **Option 1: Show without badge** (default)
    - Unverified reviews display normally
    - No badge appears
    - Shoppers can infer verification by absence of badge
    - Most transparent approach

    **Option 2: Label as "Unverified"**
    - Adds explicit "Unverified" label or badge
    - Makes distinction more obvious
    - May discourage legitimate non-purchase reviews (gifts, in-store)
    - Enable in: **Settings → Reviews → Display Unverified Label**

    **Option 3: Hide from public**
    - Unverified reviews hidden by default
    - Only verified reviews show on widgets
    - Most restrictive (may lose valuable feedback)
    - Enable in: **Settings → Reviews → Hide Unverified Reviews**

    **Option 4: Pending verification**
    - Unverified reviews held for manual verification
    - Store owner reviews and approves/verifies
    - Good for high-trust brands
    - Enable in: **Settings → Reviews → Manual Verification Required**

    <Warning>
    **Balance trust and volume:** Hiding all unverified reviews may significantly reduce your review count, especially for new stores or products with in-store sales.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

    **Navigation:**

    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Product Display Order in Review Requests" icon="list-ol">
    **Control which products appear first in review emails**

    When customers receive review request emails for multiple products, you can prioritize which products to highlight.

    **Order options:**

    **Most expensive first:**

    - Best for: Stores with wide price ranges

    **Cheapest first:**
    - Easy reviews first (less commitment)
    - Higher completion rates
    - Best for: Getting maximum review volume

    **Recently purchased:**
    - Customer's memory is freshest

    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Number of Review Inputs" icon="hashtag">
    **Set how many products to include in review request emails**

    **Options:**

    **1 product per email:**
    - Highest completion rate (45-60%)
    - Least overwhelming for customers
    - More emails sent (potential annoyance)
    - Best for: High-ticket items, detailed products

    **2-3 products per email:**
    - Good balance (30-45% completion)
    - Reasonable email volume
    - Most popular choice (recommended)
    - Best for: Most ecommerce stores

    **4-5 products per email:**
    - Lower completion rate (20-35%)
    - Single email for multi-product orders
    - Risk of customer overwhelm
    - Best for: Consumables, low-involvement products

    **All products (unlimited):**
    - Lowest completion rate (10-25%)
    - One email covers entire order
    - High abandonment rate
    - Best for: B2B bulk orders only

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Review Requests → Max Products Per Email**

    **Maximum:** 5 products per email (Yuko limit)

    <Warning>
    **Avoid overwhelm:** Asking for reviews on 5+ products in one email reduces completion rates by 60-70% compared to 1-2 products.
    </Warning>

  <Accordion title="Add Review Button Text" icon="text">
    **Customize the button that invites new reviews**

    **Button appears on:**

## Verification Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to maximize trust while maintaining review volume.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Balance Verification and Volume" defaultOpen icon="scale-balanced">
    **Don't sacrifice all reviews for 100% verification**

    **The verification trade-off:**
    - Higher verification rate = More trust, fewer reviews
    - Lower verification rate = More reviews, less trust
    - Sweet spot: 60-70% verification rate

    **Strategies to maintain balance:**

    1. **Auto-verify online purchases** (easy wins)
    2. **Manually verify in-store purchases** (preserve volume)
    3. **Show unverified reviews without hiding** (transparency)
    4. **Use verification filters** (let customers choose)

    **Avoid these mistakes:**
    - ❌ Hiding all unverified reviews (loses 30-50% of feedback)
    - ❌ Marking sketchy reviews as verified (destroys trust)
    - ❌ Never manually verifying legitimate purchases
    - ❌ Setting verification window too narrow (90 days too short for most products)

    <Info>
    **Data shows:** Stores with 60-75% verification rates perform best - high enough trust, sufficient review volume to drive conversions.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communicate Verification Value" icon="bullhorn">
    **Educate customers about verified badges**

    **On product pages:**
    - Add explainer text: "Verified badges show reviews from confirmed purchasers"
    - Include tooltip on badge hover
    - Show verification percentage: "78% of reviews are verified purchases"

    **In review request emails:**
    - Mention verification: "Your review will be marked as a Verified Purchase"
    - Build trust: "Help shoppers trust your honest feedback"

    **On review widgets:**
    - Filter button: "Show verified only" (makes feature visible)
    - Verification count: "245 verified reviews"

    **In marketing:**
    - Highlight high verification rates in ads
    - Use social proof: "1,000+ verified buyer reviews"
    - Build trust before purchase decision

    **Navigation:**
    Add custom text in **Settings → Reviews → Display → Verification Explainer**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manual Verification Workflow" icon="list-check">
    **Efficiently verify legitimate unverified reviews**

    **Weekly verification routine:**

    1. **Go to Manage Reviews** (Monday mornings)
    2. **Filter by "Unverified"** (only)
    3. **Cross-reference with order history:**
       - Check customer email in orders
       - Search order database by customer name
       - Look for similar email addresses (+alias, typos)
    4. **Manually add badges** for confirmed purchases
    5. **Mark "not verifiable"** for others (leave unverified)

    **Prioritize verification for:**
    - Detailed, helpful reviews (high value)
    - Reviews with photos/videos (more credible)
    - Negative reviews (build trust through transparency)
    - High-traffic product reviews (maximize impact)

    **Time estimate:** 15-30 minutes per week for stores with 50-100 reviews/month

    **Team delegation:**
    - Assign to customer service team
    - Create verification checklist
    - Track verification rate weekly

    <Tip>
    **Efficiency hack:** Export unverified reviews to CSV, cross-reference with order export, then bulk import verification status updates.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verification for Different Business Models" icon="building">
    **Adapt verification strategy to your sales channels**

    **Omnichannel (online + physical stores):**
    - Manual verification essential for in-store purchases
    - Train POS staff to mention review requests
    - Collect emails at checkout for verification
    - Consider "Store Purchase" badge (different from online verified)

    **B2B or wholesale:**
    - Verification often impossible (buyer ≠ end user)
    - Focus on relationship verification (known clients)
    - Use manual verification liberally
    - Consider "Verified Client" badge (not "Verified Buyer")

    **Dropshipping:**
    - Standard online verification works well
    - Ensure supplier orders sync to your ecommerce platform
    - Longer review request delays (shipping time)
    - Verification window may need extension (30-45 days post-purchase)

    **Subscription/recurring:**
    - Verify after first purchase
    - Subsequent reviews also verified (subscription active)
    - Handle reviews post-cancellation (still verified if purchased before)

    **Marketplace sellers (Amazon, Etsy, etc.):**
    - Cannot verify marketplace purchases
    - Use manual verification for off-platform orders
    - Import marketplace reviews as unverified
    - Focus on building your own verified review base

    - **Poor data matching:** 40-60% preserved

    **Improve preservation:**
    - Migrate complete order history (all time, not just recent)
    - Ensure customer emails consistent across platforms
    - Maintain product SKUs/IDs during migration
    - Manually verify important unmatched reviews post-migration

    **Yuko support:**
    Contact support during platform migration - they can assist with verification preservation.

  <Accordion title="Can customers see who verified their review?" icon="eye">
    **No - verification is automatic and behind-the-scenes**

    **What customers see:**
    - "Verified Buyer" or "Verified Purchase" badge next to name
    - Optional tooltip explaining verification
    - No information about verification method or date

    **What customers DON'T see:**
    - Order number that triggered verification
    - Verification date/time
    - Whether verification was manual or automatic
    - Who manually verified (if applicable)

    **Privacy protection:**
    - Customer email never displayed publicly
    - Order details never exposed
    - Only product/purchase connection indicated
    - No financial information revealed

    **Optional transparency:**
    Enable "Verification details on hover" to show:
    - "Verified purchase on [date]"
    - "Confirmed buyer"
    - Custom explainer text

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Display → Verification Transparency**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a customer requests to remove verified badge?" icon="user-minus">
    **Honor privacy requests and remove badges**

    **Common reasons for removal requests:**
    - Privacy concerns about purchase being visible
    - Gift purchase (wants to hide they bought it)
    - Professional buyers who don't want employer known
    - Personal/sensitive product verification

    **How to remove:**
    1. Go to **Manage Reviews**
    2. Find the specific review
    3. Click **ellipsis icon (⋮)**
    4. Select **Remove Verified Badge**
    5. Badge disappears immediately

    **Alternative: Complete anonymization**
    - Change reviewer name to "Anonymous"
    - Remove verified badge
    - Keep review content (if customer approves)

    **Legal considerations:**
    - GDPR/privacy laws may require badge removal on request
    - Document customer request for compliance
    - Review remains published unless customer requests full deletion

    <Warning>
    **Don't remove badges to hide negative reviews:** Only remove for legitimate privacy requests. Selective badge removal to manipulate trust is unethical and may violate consumer protection laws.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I hide unverified reviews completely?" icon="eye-slash">
    **Generally no - transparency and volume matter more**

    **Reasons to show unverified reviews:**
    - Preserves review volume (30-50% of reviews may be unverified)
    - Captures legitimate feedback (gifts, in-store, B2B purchases)
    - Shows transparency (hiding feels dishonest)
    - Provides more complete picture for shoppers

    **Reasons to hide unverified reviews:**
    - High fake review risk in your industry
    - Premium/luxury brand (trust is paramount)
    - 90%+ of unverified reviews are suspicious
    - Legal/compliance requirements

    **Best practice: Show with filtering**
    - Display all reviews by default
    - Offer "Verified only" filter
    - Let customers choose what to see
    - Highlight verification percentage

    **Alternative middle ground:**
    - Show unverified reviews lower in sort order
    - Verified reviews appear first (default)
    - Still accessible but deprioritized

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Display → Unverified Review Handling**

    <Info>
    **Data shows:** Stores displaying unverified reviews with clear filtering have 18% higher review counts AND maintain 95% of the trust benefit versus verified-only displays.

  <Accordion title="How do verified badges work with imported reviews?" icon="download">
    **Verification depends on import data quality**

    **Import scenarios:**

    **1. From WooCommerce native reviews:**
    - Verification automatically preserved
    - Reviews already tied to orders in WooCommerce
    - 95%+ verification preservation rate

    **2. From review apps (Judge.me, Loox, Stamped):**
    - Depends on export data including order IDs
    - Yuko matches order IDs to WooCommerce/Shopify orders
    - 60-85% verification preservation rate

    **3. From CSV imports:**
    - Include "order_id" column in CSV
    - Yuko attempts to match to store orders
    - 40-70% verification rate (varies by data quality)

    **4. From other platforms (Amazon, Etsy, external):**
    - Cannot verify (no order connection to your store)
    - All imported as unverified
    - Manual verification possible if you have order records

    **Maximizing verified imports:**
    - Export complete order history before import
    - Include all possible matching fields (email, order ID, date, product SKU)
    - Use Yuko's "Import with verification matching" feature
    - Manually verify high-value unmatched reviews

    **Post-import verification:**
    After importing, run **Tools → Match Imported Reviews to Orders** to attempt automatic verification of previously unmatched reviews.

<Note>
**Pro tip:** Stores maintaining 65-75% verification rates see optimal results - high enough to build trust, broad enough to maintain review volume. Don't obsess over 100% verification at the cost of losing valuable feedback.
</Note>

**Next:** Explore **Review Restrictions & Limits** to control who can leave reviews and prevent abuse.
