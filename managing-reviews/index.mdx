### Review Status Types

Every review has a status that determines whether it's visible to customers:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title=" Published">
    **Reviews visible on your store**

    **What this means:**

    - Shown on product pages and review widgets
    - Counted toward average ratings
    - Included in search-indexed content
    - Fully visible to shoppers

    **When to publish:**

    - Helpful, constructive feedback
    - Verified or genuine reviews
    - Clear and appropriate language
    - Reviews that add value to your store

    Publishing quality reviews strengthens trust and increases conversions.

    **Approved reviews are your social proof** - they drive sales
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Pending ">
    **Reviews waiting for your approval**

    **What this means:**

    - Not yet visible to customers
    - Do not affect average rating
    - Require a manual action from you
    - Can be published or moved to spam/trash

    **How reviews become pending:**

    - Auto-publish disabled (all reviews pending)
    - Low star ratings (1-3 stars if auto-publish only 4-5)
    - First-time reviewers (trust verification)
    - Flagged by spam filters (needs manual check)
    - Contains certain keywords (custom moderation rules)

    **What to do with pending reviews:**

    - Review content for quality and appropriateness
    - Approve if legitimate
    - Reject if spam or inappropriate
    - Reply before publishing (address concerns)

    **Response time matters** - approve within 24 hours for best results
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Spam">
    **Reviews marked as spam or fake**

    **What this means:**

    - Hidden from all customer-facing areas
    - Not counted in ratings
    - Stored in the Spam folder
    - Can be restored if incorrectly flagged

    **Common spam indicators:**

    - Irrelevant, nonsensical, or promotional content
    - Attempts to post links or advertisements
    - Duplicate submissions
    - Reviews clearly not linked to real customers

    Use the Spam folder to keep harmful or misleading content out of your store.

    **Don't delete immediately** - review spam folder occasionally for false positives
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Trash ">
    **Reviews removed but recoverable**

    **What this means:**

    - Not visible anywhere
    - Stored in the Trash section
    - Can be restored
    - Permanently deleted after 30 days

    **Why move to trash:**

    - Customer requested deletion
    - Duplicate reviews
    - Review for wrong product
    - Outdated information
    - Policy violation

    **Trash vs Spam:**

    - Trash: Legitimate reviews you don't want displayed
    - Spam: Fake/malicious reviews

    **Recovery option:**

    - Trash allows 30-day recovery period
    - Restore if deleted by mistake
    - Permanent after 30 days

    **Best practice:** Use trash for legitimate deletions, spam for fake reviews
