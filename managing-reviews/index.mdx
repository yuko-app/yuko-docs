## Review Management Dashboard

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Manage Reviews**

### Review Status Types

Every review has a status that determines whether it's visible to customers:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title=" Published">
    **Reviews visible on your store**

    **What this means:**

    - Shown on product pages and review widgets
    - Counted toward average ratings
    - Included in search-indexed content
    - Fully visible to shoppers

    **When to publish:**

    - Helpful, constructive feedback
    - Verified or genuine reviews
    - Clear and appropriate language
    - Reviews that add value to your store

    Publishing quality reviews strengthens trust and increases conversions.

    **Approved reviews are your social proof** - they drive sales
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Pending ">
    **Reviews waiting for your approval**

    **What this means:**

    - Not yet visible to customers
    - Do not affect average rating
    - Require a manual action from you
    - Can be published or moved to spam/trash

    **How reviews become pending:**

    - Auto-publish disabled (all reviews pending)
    - Low star ratings (1-3 stars if auto-publish only 4-5)
    - First-time reviewers (trust verification)
    - Flagged by spam filters (needs manual check)
    - Contains certain keywords (custom moderation rules)

    **What to do with pending reviews:**

    - Review content for quality and appropriateness
    - Approve if legitimate
    - Reject if spam or inappropriate
    - Reply before publishing (address concerns)

    **Response time matters** - approve within 24 hours for best results
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Spam">
    **Reviews marked as spam or fake**

    **What this means:**

    - Hidden from all customer-facing areas
    - Not counted in ratings
    - Stored in the Spam folder
    - Can be restored if incorrectly flagged

    **Common spam indicators:**

    - Irrelevant, nonsensical, or promotional content
    - Attempts to post links or advertisements
    - Duplicate submissions
    - Reviews clearly not linked to real customers

    Use the Spam folder to keep harmful or misleading content out of your store.

    **Don't delete immediately** - review spam folder occasionally for false positives
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Trash ">
    **Reviews removed but recoverable**

    **What this means:**

    - Not visible anywhere
    - Stored in the Trash section
    - Can be restored
    - Permanently deleted after 30 days

    **Why move to trash:**

    - Customer requested deletion
    - Duplicate reviews
    - Review for wrong product
    - Outdated information
    - Policy violation

    **Trash vs Spam:**

    - Trash: Legitimate reviews you don't want displayed
    - Spam: Fake/malicious reviews

    **Recovery option:**

    - Trash allows 30-day recovery period
    - Restore if deleted by mistake
    - Permanent after 30 days

    **Best practice:** Use trash for legitimate deletions, spam for fake reviews

## Best Practices for Review Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Respond to Reviews Quickly" defaultOpen icon="clock">
    **Speed matters for reputation management**

    **Response time impact:**

    - Within 24 hours: 70% positive perception
    - Within 48 hours: 50% positive perception
    - Within 1 week: 30% positive perception
    - After 1 week: Minimal impact

    **Prioritize by urgency:**

    **Urgent (respond within 4 hours):**

    - 1-star reviews with specific complaints
    - Reviews mentioning legal issues
    - Reviews with safety concerns
    - Reviews going viral (social media shares)

    **High priority (within 24 hours):**

    - 2-3 star reviews (address concerns)
    - Reviews asking questions
    - First-time reviewer (encourage more)
    - Verified purchase negative feedback

    **Medium priority (within 48 hours):**

    - 4-star reviews (thank + address minor concern)
    - 5-star reviews without photos
    - Reviews mentioning competitors

    **Low priority (within 1 week):**

    - 5-star reviews with photos (thank customer)
    - Generic positive reviews
    - Brief "Great!" reviews

    <Check>
      **Set up alerts:** Get email notification for 1-2 star reviews so you can respond immediately before reputation damage.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't Delete Negative Reviews (Usually)" icon="shield-exclamation">
    **Authenticity builds more trust than perfection**

    **Why keep negative reviews:**

    - **Authenticity:** All 5-star reviews look fake
    - **SEO value:** Review variety ranks better
    - **Learning:** Identify improvement opportunities
    - **Trust:** Customers know no product is perfect
    - **Legal:** Some regions prohibit selective deletion

    **What % of negative reviews is normal:**

    - 5-10% = Excellent (realistic, trusted)
    - 10-20% = Good (authentic, competitive)
    - 20-30% = Acceptable (work on quality)
    - 30%+ = Problem (address quality issues)

    **When you CAN delete:**

    - ✅ Spam or fake reviews
    - ✅ Offensive/profane language
    - ✅ Competitor sabotage
    - ✅ Review for wrong product
    - ✅ Personal information (privacy)
    - ✅ Violates review policies

    **When you SHOULD NOT delete:**

    - ❌ Just because it's negative
    - ❌ Customer didn't like product (valid opinion)
    - ❌ Unfair but legitimate criticism
    - ❌ 3-star "meh" reviews
    - ❌ Constructive feedback

    **Better than deleting:**

    - Reply professionally
    - Address the concern
    - Offer solution privately
    - Show you care
    - Other customers see your response

    **Real example:**

    - Negative review: "Product broke after 2 weeks"
    - Bad response: _Delete review_
    - Good response: "We're sorry to hear this! This isn't typical. Please email [support@store.com](mailto:support@store.com) with your order # and we'll send a replacement immediately. We stand behind our quality."

    **Result:** Other customers see you care and fix problems = higher trust
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Review Insights for Business Decisions" icon="lightbulb">
    **Your reviews are free market research**

    **Product development:**

    - What features do customers want? (Read 3-4 star reviews)
    - What's missing? ("I wish it had...")
    - What's confusing? (Common questions)
    - What should you improve? (Recurring complaints)

    **Example:** 20 reviews mention "wish it came in blue" → Launch blue color variant

    **Marketing insights:**

    - What words do customers use? (Use in copy)
    - What benefits matter most? (Feature in ads)
    - What objections do they have? (Address in description)
    - What surprises them? ("Better than expected")

    **Example:** Reviews often say "surprisingly lightweight" → Add "Ultra-lightweight design" to product title

    **Customer service improvements:**

    - Where do customers get confused? (Improve instructions)
    - What questions are asked repeatedly? (Add FAQ)
    - What part of process frustrates? (Streamline checkout)

    **Example:** 10 reviews ask "How to clean?" → Add cleaning instructions to product page

    **Competitive intelligence:**

    - How do customers compare to competitors? (Your advantages)
    - What do they switch from? (Messaging opportunity)
    - Where do you fall short? (Improvement areas)

    **Monthly review analysis routine:**

    1. Filter reviews from last 30 days
    2. Read ALL 1-3 star reviews (identify patterns)
    3. Note 5 most common themes
    4. Create action plan to address
    5. Track improvement next month

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Export all reviews to spreadsheet monthly. Use word cloud tool to visualize most common words. Spot trends visually.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Encourage Reviewers to Add Photos" icon="camera">
    **Photo reviews convert 3x better than text-only**

    **If customer submits text-only review:**

    - Reply thanking them
    - Ask if they'd add photos
    - Offer incentive (10% off next order)
    - Make it easy (email link to add photos)

    **Reply template:** "Thank you so much for your review, [Name]! We'd love to see a photo of you using [product]. Would you be willing to add a photo? As our thank you, here's 10% off your next order: [code]. You can add photos here: [link]"

    **Success rate:**

    - 15-25% of customers add photos when asked
    - Works best within 3 days of review submission
    - Highest success with 5-star reviewers

    **Why this works:**

    **Result:** More photo reviews without changing review request emails
