## Review Management Dashboard

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Manage Reviews**

### Review Status Types

Every review has a status that determines whether it's visible to customers:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title=" Published">
    **Reviews visible on your store**

    **What this means:**

    - Shown on product pages and review widgets
    - Counted toward average ratings
    - Included in search-indexed content
    - Fully visible to shoppers

    **When to publish:**

    - Helpful, constructive feedback
    - Verified or genuine reviews
    - Clear and appropriate language
    - Reviews that add value to your store

    Publishing quality reviews strengthens trust and increases conversions.

    **Approved reviews are your social proof** - they drive sales
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Pending ">
    **Reviews waiting for your approval**

    **What this means:**

    - Not yet visible to customers
    - Do not affect average rating
    - Require a manual action from you
    - Can be published or moved to spam/trash

    **How reviews become pending:**

    - Auto-publish disabled (all reviews pending)
    - Low star ratings (1-3 stars if auto-publish only 4-5)
    - First-time reviewers (trust verification)
    - Flagged by spam filters (needs manual check)
    - Contains certain keywords (custom moderation rules)

    **What to do with pending reviews:**

    - Review content for quality and appropriateness
    - Approve if legitimate
    - Reject if spam or inappropriate
    - Reply before publishing (address concerns)

    **Response time matters** - approve within 24 hours for best results
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Spam">
    **Reviews marked as spam or fake**

    **What this means:**

    - Hidden from all customer-facing areas
    - Not counted in ratings
    - Stored in the Spam folder
    - Can be restored if incorrectly flagged

    **Common spam indicators:**

    - Irrelevant, nonsensical, or promotional content
    - Attempts to post links or advertisements
    - Duplicate submissions
    - Reviews clearly not linked to real customers

    Use the Spam folder to keep harmful or misleading content out of your store.

    **Don't delete immediately** - review spam folder occasionally for false positives
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Trash ">
    **Reviews removed but recoverable**

    **What this means:**

    - Not visible anywhere
    - Stored in the Trash section
    - Can be restored
    - Permanently deleted after 30 days

    **Why move to trash:**

    - Customer requested deletion
    - Duplicate reviews
    - Review for wrong product
    - Outdated information
    - Policy violation

    **Trash vs Spam:**

    - Trash: Legitimate reviews you don't want displayed
    - Spam: Fake/malicious reviews

    **Recovery option:**

    - Trash allows 30-day recovery period
    - Restore if deleted by mistake
    - Permanent after 30 days

    **Best practice:** Use trash for legitimate deletions, spam for fake reviews

## Best Practices for Review Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Respond to Reviews Quickly" defaultOpen icon="clock">
    **Speed matters for reputation management**

    **Response time impact:**

    - Within 24 hours: 70% positive perception
    - Within 48 hours: 50% positive perception
    - Within 1 week: 30% positive perception
    - After 1 week: Minimal impact

    **Prioritize by urgency:**

    **Urgent (respond within 4 hours):**

    - 1-star reviews with specific complaints
    - Reviews mentioning legal issues
    - Reviews with safety concerns
    - Reviews going viral (social media shares)

    **High priority (within 24 hours):**

    - 2-3 star reviews (address concerns)

    - First-time reviewer (encourage more)
    - Verified purchase negative feedback

    - Reviews mentioning competitors

    **Low priority (within 1 week):**

    - 5-star reviews with photos (thank customer)
    - Generic positive reviews
    - Brief "Great!" reviews

    <Check>
      **Set up alerts:** Get email notification for 1-2 star reviews so you can respond immediately before reputation damage.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't Delete Negative Reviews (Usually)" icon="shield-exclamation">
    **Authenticity builds more trust than perfection**

    **Why keep negative reviews:**

    - **Authenticity:** All 5-star reviews look fake
    - **SEO value:** Review variety ranks better
    - **Learning:** Identify improvement opportunities
    - **Trust:** Customers know no product is perfect
    - **Legal:** Some regions prohibit selective deletion

    **What % of negative reviews is normal:**

    - 5-10% = Excellent (realistic, trusted)
    - 10-20% = Good (authentic, competitive)
    - 20-30% = Acceptable (work on quality)
    - 30%+ = Problem (address quality issues)

    **When you CAN delete:**

    - ✅ Spam or fake reviews
    - ✅ Offensive/profane language
    - ✅ Competitor sabotage
    - ✅ Review for wrong product
    - ✅ Personal information (privacy)
    - ✅ Violates review policies

    **When you SHOULD NOT delete:**

    - ❌ Just because it's negative
    - ❌ Customer didn't like product (valid opinion)
    - ❌ Unfair but legitimate criticism
    - ❌ 3-star "meh" reviews
    - ❌ Constructive feedback

    **Better than deleting:**

    - Reply professionally
    - Address the concern
    - Offer solution privately
    - Show you care
    - Other customers see your response

    **Real example:**

    - Negative review: "Product broke after 2 weeks"
    - Bad response: _Delete review_
    - Good response: "We're sorry to hear this! This isn't typical. Please email [support@store.com](mailto:support@store.com) with your order # and we'll send a replacement immediately. We stand behind our quality."

    **Result:** Other customers see you care and fix problems = higher trust
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Review Insights for Business Decisions" icon="lightbulb">
    **Your reviews are free market research**

    **Product development:**

    - What features do customers want? (Read 3-4 star reviews)
    - What's missing? ("I wish it had...")
    - What's confusing? (Common questions)
    - What should you improve? (Recurring complaints)

    **Example:** 20 reviews mention "wish it came in blue" → Launch blue color variant

    **Marketing insights:**

    - What words do customers use? (Use in copy)
    - What benefits matter most? (Feature in ads)
    - What objections do they have? (Address in description)
    - What surprises them? ("Better than expected")

    **Example:** Reviews often say "surprisingly lightweight" → Add "Ultra-lightweight design" to product title

    **Customer service improvements:**

    - Where do customers get confused? (Improve instructions)
    - What questions are asked repeatedly? (Add FAQ)
    - What part of process frustrates? (Streamline checkout)

    **Example:** 10 reviews ask "How to clean?" → Add cleaning instructions to product page

    **Competitive intelligence:**

    - How do customers compare to competitors? (Your advantages)
    - What do they switch from? (Messaging opportunity)
    - Where do you fall short? (Improvement areas)

    **Monthly review analysis routine:**

    1. Filter reviews from last 30 days
    2. Read ALL 1-3 star reviews (identify patterns)
    3. Note 5 most common themes
    4. Create action plan to address
    5. Track improvement next month

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Export all reviews to spreadsheet monthly. Use word cloud tool to visualize most common words. Spot trends visually.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Encourage Reviewers to Add Photos" icon="camera">
    **Photo reviews convert 3x better than text-only**

    **If customer submits text-only review:**

    - Reply thanking them
    - Ask if they'd add photos
    - Offer incentive (10% off next order)
    - Make it easy (email link to add photos)

    **Reply template:** "Thank you so much for your review, [Name]! We'd love to see a photo of you using [product]. Would you be willing to add a photo? As our thank you, here's 10% off your next order: [code]. You can add photos here: [link]"

    **Success rate:**

    - 15-25% of customers add photos when asked
    - Works best within 3 days of review submission
    - Highest success with 5-star reviewers

    **Why this works:**

    - Customers already engaged (just left review)
    - Incentive feels like reward, not bribe
    - Easy to do (direct link)
    - Flatters customer (you want to feature them)

    **Result:** More photo reviews without changing review request emails

    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if a review is unfair or inaccurate?" icon="scale-unbalanced">
    **You can reply, but usually shouldn't delete**

    **If review is factually wrong:**

    **Example:** "Product is plastic, description says metal" **Your options:**

    1. Reply correcting error: "Our product is actually stainless steel as described. We'd love to resolve this. Please email support@..."
    2. If customer ordered wrong product variant, explain politely
    3. If genuinely misunderstood, clarify

    **Don't delete** - reply corrects misinformation publicly

    **If review is subjectively negative:**

    **Example:** "I don't like the color" **Your options:**

    1. Reply: "Sorry it wasn't what you expected! We offer free returns within 30 days."
    2. Leave it - legitimate opinion
    3. Use feedback to improve product photos (color accuracy)

    **Don't delete** - subjective opinions are valid

    **If review is unfair/unreasonable:**

    **Example:** "1 star - shipping took 3 days" (when 3-5 days promised) **Your options:**

    1. Reply: "Thanks for your feedback! We delivered within our 3-5 day window. Sorry it felt too long. For faster shipping, we offer 2-day express option."
    2. Kill them with kindness
    3. Other customers see you're reasonable

    - Review for completely wrong product
    - Contains false claims (defamation)
    - Offensive/profane language

    - Encourages more reviews

    **Medium volume (20-100 reviews/month):**

    - Reply to all 1-3 star reviews (required)
    - Reply to 5-star reviews with photos (thank them)
    - Reply to 4-star reviews (address minor concern)
    - Skip brief 5-star "Great!" reviews (too many)

    **High volume (100+ reviews/month):**

    - Reply to all 1-2 star reviews (urgent)
    - Reply to detailed 5-star reviews
    - Reply to reviews with questions
    - Skip generic positive reviews (unsustainable)

    **What to prioritize:**

    1. **1-2 star reviews** (respond within 24 hours) - damage control
    2. **Reviews with questions** (answer publicly) - helps other shoppers
    3. **Detailed 5-star reviews** (thank customer) - recognition
    4. **4-star reviews** (address concern) - could become 5-star
    5. **3-star reviews** (understand issue) - improvement opportunity

    **Template responses:**

    - 5-star: "Thank you, [Name]! We're thrilled you're happy with [product]. Customers like you make our day! 💙"
    - 1-2 star: "We're sorry about your experience, [Name]. This isn't our standard. Please email support@ and we'll make it right."
    - Question: "Great question! [Answer]. Hope this helps!"

    <Check>
      **Quality over quantity:** One thoughtful response to a negative review is worth more than 10 generic "thanks!" to positive reviews.

  <Accordion title="Can I edit customer reviews after they're submitted?" icon="pen">
    **Yes, but use carefully and ethically**

    **What you CAN edit:**

    - Fix obvious typos ("amzing" → "amazing")
    - Remove customer's personal information (phone, address)
    - Remove offensive language (replace with "[removed]")
    - Correct product assignment (review on wrong product)
    - Fix formatting (add line breaks for readability)

    **What you CANNOT edit:**

    - Change review sentiment (negative → positive)
    - Remove valid criticism
    - Add fake positive content
    - Alter star rating
    - Change meaning of review

    **Ethical guidelines:**

    - Edit minimally
    - Never change meaning
    - Transparent edits (note if significant)
    - Only edit for clear improvements
    - Get customer permission if major changes

    **When to edit:**

    **Scenario 1: Customer asks** "Customer emails: "Can you remove my phone number from my review?" **Action:** Edit review, remove phone number, note: "Edited to remove personal info"

    **Scenario 2: Profanity** Review: "This f\*\*\_ing product is sh_t" **Action:** Edit to "This [removed] product is [removed]" OR delete entirely (violates policy)

    **Scenario 3: Wrong product** Review on Product A mentions Product B **Action:** Move review to Product B, note: "Review moved to correct product"

    **Scenario 4: Typo affects meaning** Review: "Product is NOT amazing" Customer meant: "Product is NOW amazing" (typo) **Action:** Email customer asking permission to fix typo

    **What to avoid:**

    - Editing reviews to remove criticism
    - Making negative reviews sound positive
    - Changing star ratings
    - Adding content customer didn't write

    **Transparency wins:**

    - If edit is significant, add note: "(Edited by store to [reason])"
    - Builds trust vs hiding edits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What should I do with really old reviews?" icon="calendar-days">
    **Keep, archive, or delete based on relevance**

    **Keep old reviews if:**

    - Product hasn't changed significantly
    - Reviews still accurate and relevant
    - Historical social proof valuable
    - Review content high quality

    **Archive/hide old reviews if:**

    - Product significantly improved (old reviews don't reflect current quality)
    - Reviews mention old pricing/policies
    - Product redesigned (old version reviews confusing)
    - Very old (5+ years) and product evolved

    **How to handle:**

    **Option 1: Keep with context**

    - Keep old reviews visible
    - Add store note: "This review is from 2019. We've since updated the product with [improvements]."
    - Shows transparency and improvement

    **Option 2: Archive separately**

    - Move old reviews (3+ years) to "Archived Reviews" section
    - Not displayed by default
    - Available if customers want to see
    - Maintains history without confusion

    **Option 3: Delete if truly irrelevant**

    - Product completely different now
    - Old reviews misleading
    - Reviews for discontinued version
    - Delete but export first (historical record)

    **Best practice:**

    - For products 1-3 years old: Keep all reviews
    - For products 3-5 years old: Archive reviews mentioning outdated info
    - For products 5+ years old: Hide/delete if product significantly changed

    **Add new reviews:**

    - If product improved based on old negative feedback
    - Request new reviews from recent customers
    - Build fresh review base
    - Old negative reviews become less prominent

    <Note>
      **Don't mass-delete:** Gradual archiving better than sudden deletion. Keeps SEO value while maintaining relevance.
