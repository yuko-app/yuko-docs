## Profanity Filter

Block or censor offensive language automatically:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Replace with Asterisks">
    **Automatically censor profanity**

    **How it works:**
    - Yuko detects profane words in reviews
    - Replaces with asterisks (f*** or ****)
    - Review text published with censorship
    - Customer message unchanged in database

    **Example:**
    - Customer writes: "This f***ing product is amazing!"
    - Displays as: "This **** product is amazing!"

    **Settings:**
    ```
    Profanity filter:
    [✓] Replace with asterisks (****)
    [ ] Hide review entirely
    [ ] Hold for manual review
    ```

    **Pros:**
    - Review sentiment preserved
    - Automatic moderation
    - No manual work
    - Still shows enthusiasm

    **Cons:**
    - Obvious censorship visible
    - May look unprofessional
    - Customer didn't consent to edit

    **Best for:** Casual brands, high review volume

    <Tip>
    **Recommended:** Use replacement for mild profanity. For severe language, use "hold for review" instead.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Hide Review Entirely">
    **Block reviews with profanity**

    **How it works:**
    - Yuko detects profane words
    - Review automatically hidden
    - Sent to spam folder
    - Never published publicly

    **Example:**
    - Customer writes: "This s*** doesn't work"
    - Review → Auto-hidden, marked as spam
    - Not visible to other customers

    **Settings:**
    ```
    Profanity filter:
    [ ] Replace with asterisks (****)
    [✓] Hide review entirely
    [ ] Hold for manual review
    ```

    **Pros:**
    - Professional appearance
    - No offensive language visible
    - Simple solution

    **Cons:**
    - Lose potentially valuable feedback
    - Customer's legitimate complaint hidden
    - May violate review transparency
    - False positives (innocent words flagged)

    **Best for:** Conservative brands, family products

    **Warning:** May hide legitimate negative reviews. Check spam folder weekly for false positives.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Hold for Manual Review">
    **Flag profanity for your review**

    **How it works:**
    - Yuko detects profane words
    - Review sent to pending
    - You review manually
    - Decide: Approve, edit, or reject

    **Example:**
    - Customer writes: "Amazing! Worth every damn penny"
    - Review → Pending (contains "damn")
    - You review: Approve (positive context)
    - Or edit: "Amazing! Worth every penny"

    **Settings:**
    ```
    Profanity filter:
    [ ] Replace with asterisks (****)
    [ ] Hide review entirely
    [✓] Hold for manual review
    ```

    **Pros:**
    - Context-aware decisions
    - Keep valuable feedback
    - Edit rather than delete
    - Catch severe language

    **Cons:**
    - Manual work required
    - Slower review publishing
    - Time investment

    **Best for:** Most stores (balanced approach)

    **Time investment:** 5-10 min/day if catching 5-10 reviews

    <Check>
    **Best practice:** Hold for manual review. This lets you approve mild language in positive reviews while blocking severe profanity in negative reviews.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Profanity Filter Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Default Word List" defaultOpen icon="list">
    **Common profanity automatically detected**

    **Included by default:**
    - Common swear words (English)
    - Offensive slurs
    - Inappropriate content
    - Vulgar language

    **How it works:**
    - Yuko maintains updated list
    - Detects variations (f*ck, fvck, etc.)
    - Case-insensitive matching
    - Partial word matching

    **Limitations:**
    - English-focused (limited multilingual)
    - May miss creative spellings
    - Context-blind (can't tell positive vs negative)

    **False positives:**
    - "Damn good" → Flagged (but positive)
    - Brand names that contain flagged words
    - Place names (Scunthorpe problem)
    - Medical terms

    **Recommendation:** Use "hold for review" to catch false positives
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom Word List" icon="plus">
    **Add your own blocked words**

    **When to add custom words:**
    - Industry-specific offensive terms
    - Competitor brand names (if you want to moderate)
    - Product names you want to review manually
    - Spam phrases ("click here", "free gift")

    **How to add:**
    1. Go to Settings → Reviews → Profanity Filter
    2. Click "Add Custom Words"
    3. Enter words (one per line)
    4. Save

    **Example custom word list:**
    ```
    [competitor brand]
    [competitor product]
    fake
    scam
    lawsuit
    lawyer
    refund (hold for review, may be legitimate)
    ```

    **Action for custom words:**
    - Same as default profanity (replace, hide, or hold)
    - Or set per-word action (advanced)

    **Warning:** Don't over-block. Words like "refund" or "return" may be legitimate complaints you should address, not hide.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Whitelist (Exceptions)" icon="check">
    **Allow specific words even if profane**

    **Use cases:**
    - Your product name contains flagged word
    - Place names false positives
    - Brand names with unfortunate words
    - Context where word is appropriate

    **How to whitelist:**
    1. Go to Settings → Reviews → Profanity Filter
    2. Click "Whitelist"
    3. Add words to never flag
    4. Save

    **Example whitelist:**
    - Your brand name: "Damn Good Coffee" (contains "damn")
    - Product line: "Hell's Kitchen Knives" (contains "hell")
    - Place: "Fucking, Austria" (actual place name)

    **Effect:** These words never trigger profanity filter, even if profane
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Spam Detection

Automatically catch and block spam reviews:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Email Domain Filtering" icon="envelope">
    Block reviews from known spam domains.

    **How it works:**
    - Yuko maintains list of disposable email domains
    - Reviews from these domains auto-flagged as spam
    - Examples: tempmail.com, 10minutemail.com, guerrillamail.com

    **Your email blacklist:**
    - Add specific domains you've seen spam from
    - Block competitor domains (optional)
    - Add patterns (like *@spam.com)

    → [Email blacklist setup](/managing-reviews/email-blacklist)

    **Automatic blocking:**
    - Disposable email domains
    - Known spam email patterns
    - Multiple reviews from same email

    **Action:** Reviews auto-hidden or pending for manual verification
  </Step>

  <Step title="Duplicate Detection" icon="clone">
    Catch copy-paste spam reviews.

    **How it works:**
    - Yuko checks if review text matches existing reviews
    - 90%+ similarity = duplicate
    - Flags for manual review

    **Catches:**
    - Exact copy-paste spam
    - Bot-generated reviews (same template)
    - Competitor attack (same negative review on multiple products)

    **Settings:**
    - Similarity threshold (default: 90%)
    - Action: Hold for review or auto-hide
    - Timeframe: Check duplicates in last X days

    **False positives:**
    - Legitimate customers with similar feedback
    - Common phrases ("Great product!")
    - Generic positive reviews

    **Solution:** Manual review of flagged duplicates
  </Step>

  <Step title="Suspicious Patterns" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Detect unusual review submission patterns.

    **What Yuko flags:**
    - Multiple reviews from same IP in short time
    - Reviews submitted in rapid succession
    - New email submitting many reviews quickly
    - Reviews for products not in order history

    **Examples of suspicious activity:**
    - 10 reviews from same IP in 1 hour (bot)
    - Same person reviewing 20 products (hasn't bought)
    - Burst of 1-star reviews in 10 minutes (attack)

    **Action:** Flagged reviews sent to pending for your review

    **Review the pattern:**
    - Legitimate? Approve
    - Spam attack? Bulk reject and blacklist email/IP
    - Competitor sabotage? Report and block
  </Step>

  <Step title="Content Analysis" icon="brain">
    AI detects spam-like content.

    **What Yuko analyzes:**
    - Gibberish text ("asdfghjkl")
    - Too generic ("good product")
    - Contains URLs or links
    - All caps (SCREAMING)
    - Excessive punctuation (!!!!!!)

    **Spam indicators:**
    - Links to other websites
    - Contact information (phone, email)
    - Promotional language ("buy now", "discount code")
    - Off-topic content
    - Review for wrong product entirely

    **Confidence score:**
    - High confidence spam (95%+): Auto-hide
    - Medium confidence (70-95%): Pending review
    - Low confidence (less than 70%): Publish (with other filters)

    **You can adjust sensitivity:**
    - Aggressive: Catch more spam, more false positives
    - Balanced: Default setting
    - Lenient: Fewer false positives, miss some spam
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Review Restrictions & Limits

Prevent abuse with submission limits:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="One Review Per Customer Per Product" icon="user">
    **Prevent duplicate reviews**

    **How it works:**
    - Customer can only review each product once
    - Attempting second review shows error
    - Or: Replaces first review with new one

    **Why enable:**
    - Prevents spam (same person, many reviews)
    - Authentic review count
    - No gaming the system

    **Exception:** Customer can update/edit their existing review

    → [Review restrictions](/managing-reviews/review-restrictions-limits)
  </Card>

    **Limit reviews per time period**

    **Settings:**
    - Max 5 reviews per email per day
    - Max 10 reviews per IP per day
    - Cooldown: 1 hour between reviews

    **Why enable:**
    - Stops spam bots
    - Prevents bulk spam attacks
    - Normal customers unaffected

    **Action:** Excess reviews auto-flagged or blocked

    → [Review restrictions](/managing-reviews/review-restrictions-limits)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Minimum Purchase Requirement" icon="shopping-cart">
    **Only verified purchases can review**

    **How it works:**
    - Customer must have purchased product
    - Order verified via email match
    - Unverified reviews blocked or pending

    **Why enable:**
    - 95% spam reduction
    - Higher quality reviews

    → [Auto-publishing settings](/managing-reviews/auto-publishing-reviews)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Email Verification" icon="envelope-circle-check">
    **Require email confirmation**

    **How it works:**
    - Customer submits review

    - No click = review not published

    **Why enable:**
    - Confirms real email address

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check Spam Folder Weekly" defaultOpen icon="calendar-check">
    **Don't let legitimate reviews get lost**

    **Why:**
    - Spam filters have false positives
    - Legitimate reviews accidentally flagged
    - Customer complaint looks like spam
    - Profanity filter caught mild language

    **Weekly spam review:**
    1. Go to Reviews → Spam
    2. Sort by date (newest first)
    3. Scan for false positives
    4. Approve legitimate reviews
    5. Delete real spam

    **What to look for:**
    - Detailed negative reviews (not spam, real complaint)
    - Reviews with mild profanity in positive context
    - First-time reviewers flagged incorrectly
    - Product names triggering keyword filters

    **Action:**
    - Approve false positives
    - Update filters to prevent repeat false flags
    - Reply to recovered negative reviews

    **Time:** 10 minutes weekly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Start Conservative, Loosen Gradually" icon="gauge-simple-high">
    **Begin with strict moderation, relax as you learn patterns**

    **Month 1: Manual moderation**
    - Review every single review
    - Learn your spam patterns
    - Understand review quality
    - Set standards

    **Month 2: Add auto-approve for 5-star verified**
    - 5-star + verified = auto-publish
    - Everything else = manual review
    - See if spam increases
    - Adjust if needed

    **Month 3: Add auto-approve for 4-star verified**
    - 4-5 star + verified = auto-publish
    - 1-3 star OR unverified = manual
    - Faster social proof
    - Still catching problems

    **Month 4+: Fine-tune based on data**
    - Analyze spam rate
    - Check moderation time
    - Optimize rules
    - May loosen further or keep as-is

    **Why this works:**
    - Learn before automating
    - Build confidence in filters
    - Catch issues early
    - Scale moderation gradually

    <Tip>
    **Don't rush automation:** Taking 3 months to fully automate is better than dealing with spam attack from being too permissive too soon.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Your Spam Rate" icon="chart-line">
    **Track spam to know if filters are working**

    **Key metrics:**
    - Spam rate: % of reviews marked as spam
    - False positive rate: % of spam that should have been approved
    - Manual moderation time: Hours per week
    - Auto-publish rate: % of reviews auto-approved

    **Good spam rate:**
    - less than 5% spam = Excellent (filters working)
    - 5-10% spam = Good (normal level)
    - 10-20% spam = High (tighten filters)
    - 20%+ spam = Crisis (major filter issue)

    **If spam increasing:**
    1. Check spam folder for patterns
    2. Identify common spam sources (emails, IPs)
    3. Add to blacklist
    4. Tighten auto-publish rules
    5. Enable email verification

    **If spam too low (with high false positives):**
    1. Filters may be too strict
    2. Check spam folder for legitimate reviews
    3. Loosen keyword filters
    4. Adjust profanity sensitivity
    5. Review false positive patterns

    **Monthly review:**
    - Export spam reviews to spreadsheet
    - Look for patterns
    - Adjust filters accordingly
    - Track improvement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Blacklists Strategically" icon="ban">
    **Block repeat offenders, not entire categories**

    **Email blacklist:**
    - Add specific spam email addresses
    - Block disposable email domains
    - Blacklist competitor domains (optional)

    **Don't blacklist:**
    - Entire email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)
    - Customer who left one negative review
    - Domains used legitimately

    → [Email blacklist guide](/managing-reviews/email-blacklist)

    **Product blacklist:**
    - Temporarily blacklist new products (manual review first 30 days)
    - Blacklist problematic products (quality issues)
    - Remove from blacklist once stable

    **Don't blacklist:**
    - Products permanently (defeats auto-publish)
    - Products just because they get negative reviews
    - All products (use manual moderation instead)

    → [Product blacklist guide](/managing-reviews/product-blacklist)

    **Best practice:** Blacklists are for exceptions, not rules. Use sparingly and review quarterly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Respond Before Moderating Negatives" icon="reply">
    **Address concerns privately, then decide on publishing**

    **Workflow for negative reviews:**
    1. Negative review in pending
    2. Read carefully
    3. Contact customer privately via email
    4. Offer solution, apology, replacement
    5. THEN decide: Approve with reply, or resolve privately

    **Example:**
    - Customer: "Product broke after 2 days" (2-star review)
    - You (email): "So sorry! This isn't typical. We'll send replacement immediately + 20% refund. Can we make this right?"
    - Customer: "Yes, thank you!"
    - You: Approve review with public reply: "We're sorry about this issue and have sent a replacement. We stand behind our quality."
    - OR: Customer updates to 5-star after resolution

    **Why this works:**
    - You resolve the issue
    - Customer often updates review or doesn't mind it being public
    - Your public reply shows you care
    - Other customers see you fix problems

    **Don't:**
    - Hide legitimate complaints without addressing
    - Approve negative reviews without responding
    - Only publish positive reviews (looks suspicious)

    <Check>
    **Best practice:** Reply to ALL negative reviews before approving. Show you care publicly. This turns negative reviews into trust builders.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How strict should my profanity filter be?" icon="gauge">
    **Depends on your brand and audience**

    **Strict filtering (hide or censor):**
    - Family-friendly products
    - Children's products
    - Conservative industries
    - Religious/values-based brands
    - B2B products

    **Lenient filtering (hold for review):**
    - Casual lifestyle brands
    - Adult products
    - Streetwear/youth brands
    - Products marketed to adults
    - Authentic brand voice

    **Very lenient (no filter):**
    - Edgy brands
    - Adult-only products
    - Brands where profanity matches voice
    - High trust in customer base

    **Recommended for most stores:**
    - Hold for manual review
    - Approve mild language in positive context
    - Reject severe profanity in negative reviews
    - Context matters

    **Example decisions:**
    - "This is f***ing amazing!" → Approve (enthusiasm)
    - "This sh*t doesn't work" → Reject (add-spam)
    - "Damn good quality" → Approve (mild, positive)
    - Multiple profanity + angry → Reject or edit

    <Tip>
    **Balance authenticity with professionalism:** Customers appreciate authentic language, but excessive profanity looks unprofessional to other shoppers.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if spam filters are too aggressive?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Loosen filters if catching too many false positives**

    **Signs filters are too strict:**
    - 20%+ of spam folder is legitimate reviews
    - Customers complaining reviews not appearing
    - Many detailed negative reviews marked as spam
    - Profanity filter catching common words

    **How to loosen:**

    **1. Adjust spam sensitivity:**
    - Settings → Spam Detection → Sensitivity
    - Change from "Aggressive" to "Balanced"
    - Or "Balanced" to "Lenient"

    **2. Review profanity word list:**
    - Check custom words you added
    - Remove overly broad terms
    - Add whitelist exceptions
    - Change action from "hide" to "hold for review"

    **3. Reduce keyword blocking:**
    - Remove competitor names from blacklist (if false positives)
    - Allow certain patterns (like "refund")
    - Check email domain blacklist

    **4. Test with sample reviews:**
    - Submit test reviews with edge cases
    - See if they get through
    - Adjust filters accordingly

    **Balance:**
    - Some false positives are acceptable (weekly spam review catches them)
    - Better to catch too much than too little initially
    - Loosen gradually based on data

    **Monitoring:**
    - Check spam folder weekly
    - Track false positive rate
    - Target: less than 10% false positives
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I moderate reviews in other languages?" icon="language">
    **Yes, but may require translation or native speaker**

    **Challenges:**
    - Profanity filters are English-focused
    - Spam patterns differ by language
    - You may not understand the content
    - Context is harder without language fluency

    **Solutions:**

    **Option 1: Manual review all non-English**
    - Set rule: Non-English reviews → Pending
    - Use Google Translate to review
    - Approve if seems legitimate
    - Reject obvious spam

    **Option 2: Hire native speaker for moderation**
    - Virtual assistant fluent in language
    - Reviews non-English submissions
    - Provides moderation decision
    - Cost: $5-15/hour depending on language

    **Option 3: Auto-approve with reactive moderation**
    - Allow non-English reviews to publish
    - Customers flag inappropriate content
    - You review flagged reviews with translation
    - Remove if problematic

    **Option 4: Limit to one language**
    - Only accept English reviews
    - Block non-English submissions
    - Simpler moderation
    - But: Loses international customers

    **Recommended:** Manual review non-English with Google Translate. Most international customers leave legitimate reviews, spam is usually obvious.

  <Accordion title="How do I handle competitor attacks?" icon="shield">
    **Detect and block coordinated negative review campaigns**

    **Signs of competitor attack:**
    - Sudden spike in 1-star reviews
    - Reviews submitted in short time (minutes/hours)
    - Similar wording across reviews
    - Reviews mention competitor favorably
    - No purchase history
    - Same IP address or email pattern

    **Immediate action:**
    1. Check reviews for patterns
    2. Look at submission timestamps
    3. Check IP addresses (if available)
    4. Verify purchase history
    5. Flag all suspicious reviews

    **Blocking the attack:**
    1. Blacklist email addresses/domains
    2. Blacklist IP range if needed
    3. Enable CAPTCHA for review submission
    4. Require verified purchase temporarily
    5. Report to platform if violates terms

    **Responding:**
    - Don't hide legitimate negative reviews (even if timing is suspicious)
    - DO hide reviews with no purchase history + spam patterns
    - Reply to questionable reviews: "We can't find your order. Please email us at support@ to verify and we'll address your concern."
    - Document attack (screenshots, IP logs) for legal action if needed

    **Prevention:**
    - Verified purchase requirement
    - Email verification
    - Rate limiting (max reviews per IP)
    - CAPTCHA on review forms

    **Long-term:**
    - Build positive review volume (harder to manipulate)
    - Monitor review patterns
    - Respond to all reviews (shows engagement)
    - Report competitor to authorities if ongoing

    <Warning>
    **Don't delete legitimate negative reviews just because of timing.** If the complaints are valid, address them. Only remove obvious fake reviews with no purchase history.
    </Warning>

  <Accordion title="Can I automate moderation completely?" icon="robot">
    **Mostly yes, but some manual oversight recommended**

    **Fully automated moderation:**
    - Auto-publish based on rules (rating, verified, etc.)
    - Spam filters auto-hide obvious spam
    - Profanity filter auto-censors
    - No daily manual work

    **Works well for:**
    - High-volume stores (1,000+ reviews/month)
    - Established stores with good filters
    - Trusted customer base
    - Limited moderation time/resources

    **Still need periodic manual checks:**
    - Weekly spam folder review (false positives)
    - Monthly filter performance review
    - Quick response to flagged reviews
    - Crisis management (attack, PR issue)

    **Cannot fully automate:**
    - Context-dependent decisions
    - Nuanced negative reviews
    - First-time controversial product reviews
    - Legal/sensitive content

    **Recommended approach:**
    - Automate 90% of moderation
    - Manual oversight 10%
    - Weekly 15-minute review of exceptions
    - Adjust filters quarterly

    **Reality check:**
    - Full automation = 98% accuracy
    - 2% still needs human judgment
    - That 2% is often most important (negative reviews, edge cases)
    - Don't eliminate manual review entirely

    <Note>
    **Sweet spot:** Automate routine approvals, manually review exceptions. This balances efficiency with quality control.

**Pro tip:** Start with "hold for manual review" for profanity and spam. After 30 days, you'll understand your false positive rate and can switch to more aggressive auto-hide if filters are working well.
