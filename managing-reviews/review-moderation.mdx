## Profanity Filter

Block or censor offensive language automatically using the following settings in Yuko:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Replace with Asterisks">
    **Automatically censor profanity**

    - Offensive words or phrases in a review are automatically replaced with `***`.
    - The review remains visible on your product pages, widgets, and contributes to the average rating.
    - Ensures that genuine feedback is not lost while keeping content appropriate for all audiences.
    - Best practice: Use this for minor profanity to maintain flow of reviews without hiding customer sentiment.

    **Best for:** Casual brands, high review volume

    <Tip>
      **Recommended:** Use replacement for mild profanity. For severe language, use "hold for review" instead.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hide review containing banned words">
    **Block reviews with profanity**

    - Reviews with blocked words are automatically marked as unpublished.
    - These reviews will not appear on your store or in review widgets.
    - Ideal for severe language or inappropriate content that could harm your store’s reputation.
    - You can manually review hidden content in the dashboard to recover if needed.

      **Best for:** Stores prioritizing a fully clean review section over visibility of flagged reviews.

      **Time investment:** Medium – requires occasional review of hidden content.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Use standard blocklist (Default)">
    **Applies Yuko’s pre-configured list of common offensive words automatically.**

    - Saves time and ensures consistency in moderating inappropriate content.
    - You can combine this with custom words or phrases to tailor moderation to your store’s requirements.

    **Optional:** Upload a CSV file containing custom blocklist words. The file is securely stored and applied to all incoming reviews. You can remove or update the file anytime.

      alt="Mmnl"
      title="Mmnl"
      style={{ width:"77%" }}
    />

    <img
      src="/images/vvbv.png"
      alt="Vvbv"
      title="Vvbv"
      style={{ width:"78%" }}
    />

    \
    **Best for:** Stores starting with profanity filtering or without custom blocklist needs.

    **Time investment:** Very low – ready-to-use out of the box.

    <Check>
      **Best practice:** Regularly review your blocked words list to ensure it aligns with your brand tone and keeps your reviews trustworthy and family-friendly.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Start with "hold for manual review" for profanity and spam. After 30 days, you'll understand your false positive rate and can switch to more aggressive auto-hide if filters are working well.
