## Navigation: 

Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → General → Review Publishing & Moderation**

## Profanity Filter

Block or censor offensive language automatically:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Replace with Asterisks">
    **Automatically censor profanity**

    - Offensive words or phrases in a review are automatically replaced with `***`.
    - The review remains visible on your product pages, widgets, and contributes to the average rating.
    - Ensures that genuine feedback is not lost while keeping content appropriate for all audiences.
    - Best practice: Use this for minor profanity to maintain flow of reviews without hiding customer sentiment.

    **Best for:** Casual brands, high review volume

    <Tip>
      **Recommended:** Use replacement for mild profanity. For severe language, use "hold for review" instead.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hide review containing banned words">
    **Block reviews with profanity**

    - Reviews with blocked words are automatically marked as unpublished.
    - These reviews will not appear on your store or in review widgets.
    - Ideal for severe language or inappropriate content that could harm your store’s reputation.
    - You can manually review hidden content in the dashboard to recover if needed.

      **Best for:** Stores prioritizing a fully clean review section over visibility of flagged reviews.

      **Time investment:** Medium – requires occasional review of hidden content.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Use standard blocklist (Default)">
    **Applies Yuko’s pre-configured list of common offensive words automatically.**

    - Saves time and ensures consistency in moderating inappropriate content.
    - You can combine this with custom words or phrases to tailor moderation to your store’s requirements.

    **Optional:** Upload a CSV file containing custom blocklist words. The file is securely stored and applied to all incoming reviews. You can remove or update the file anytime.

    \
    **Best for:** Stores starting with profanity filtering or without custom blocklist needs.

    **Time investment:** Very low – ready-to-use out of the box.

    <Check>
      **Best practice:** Regularly review your blocked words list to ensure it aligns with your brand tone and keeps your reviews trustworthy and family-friendly.

### Profanity Filter Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Default Word List" defaultOpen icon="list">
    **Common profanity automatically detected**

    **Included by default:**

    - Common swear words (English)
    - Offensive slurs
    - Inappropriate content
    - Vulgar language

    **How it works:**

    - Yuko maintains updated list
    - Detects variations (f\*ck, fvck, etc.)
    - Case-insensitive matching
    - Partial word matching

    **Limitations:**

    - English-focused (limited multilingual)
    - May miss creative spellings
    - Context-blind (can't tell positive vs negative)

    **False positives:**

    - "Damn good" → Flagged (but positive)
    - Brand names that contain flagged words
    - Place names (Scunthorpe problem)
    - Medical terms

    **Recommendation:** Use "hold for review" to catch false positives
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom Word List" icon="plus">
    **Add your own blocked words**

    **When to add custom words:**

    - Industry-specific offensive terms
    - Competitor brand names (if you want to moderate)
    - Product names you want to review manually
    - Spam phrases ("click here", "free gift")

    **How to add:**

    1. Go to Settings → Reviews → Profanity Filter
    2. Click "Add Custom Words"
    3. Enter words (one per line)
    4. Save

    **Example custom word list:**

    ```
    [competitor brand]
    [competitor product]
    fake
    scam
    lawsuit
    lawyer
    refund (hold for review, may be legitimate)
    ```

    **Action for custom words:**

    - Same as default profanity (replace, hide, or hold)
    - Or set per-word action (advanced)

    **Warning:** Don't over-block. Words like "refund" or "return" may be legitimate complaints you should address, not hide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CSV Upload" icon="check">
    _Upload a CSV file containing your blocklist words_

    - Stored securely and used for profanity filtering
    - Can remove or replace the file anytime
  </Accordion>

## Spam Filter

Enable Yuko’s Spam Filter to automatically block suspicious or spammy reviews from appearing on your store. This keeps your review section clean and your ratings trustworthy.

### How It Works

- Once enabled, Yuko scans incoming reviews for common spam indicators.
- Reviews flagged as spam are automatically hidden and moved to the **Spam** section in your dashboard.

### Key Points

- **Automatic Protection:** Reduces fake, duplicate, or malicious reviews.
- **Minimal Manual Work:** Just enable the filter—Yuko handles the rest.
- **Review Spam Folder Occasionally:** Check periodically for any legitimate reviews mistakenly flagged.

### Best For

- Stores receiving frequent reviews
- Stores wanting to maintain accurate ratings and customer trust

### Time Investment

- Very low: Enable once and let Yuko filter spam automatically. Periodic checks are optional.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check Spam Folder Weekly" defaultOpen icon="calendar-check">
    **Don't let legitimate reviews get lost**

    **Why:**

    - Spam filters have false positives
    - Legitimate reviews accidentally flagged
    - Customer complaint looks like spam
    - Profanity filter caught mild language

    **Weekly spam review:**

    1. Go to Reviews → Spam
    2. Sort by date (newest first)
    3. Scan for false positives
    4. Approve legitimate reviews
    5. Delete real spam

    **What to look for:**

    - Detailed negative reviews (not spam, real complaint)
    - Reviews with mild profanity in positive context
    - First-time reviewers flagged incorrectly
    - Product names triggering keyword filters

    **Action:**

    - Approve false positives
    - Update filters to prevent repeat false flags
    - Reply to recovered negative reviews

    **Time:** 10 minutes weekly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start Conservative, Loosen Gradually" icon="gauge-simple-high">
    **Begin with strict moderation, relax as you learn patterns**

    **Month 1: Manual moderation**

    - Review every single review
    - Learn your spam patterns
    - Understand review quality
    - Set standards

    **Month 2: Add auto-approve for 5-star verified**

    - 5-star + verified = auto-publish
    - Everything else = manual review
    - See if spam increases
    - Adjust if needed

    **Month 3: Add auto-approve for 4-star verified**

    - 4-5 star + verified = auto-publish
    - 1-3 star OR unverified = manual
    - Faster social proof
    - Still catching problems

    **Month 4+: Fine-tune based on data**

    - Analyze spam rate
    - Check moderation time
    - Optimize rules
    - May loosen further or keep as-is

    **Why this works:**

    - Learn before automating
    - Build confidence in filters
    - Catch issues early
    - Scale moderation gradually

    <Tip>
      **Don't rush automation:** Taking 3 months to fully automate is better than dealing with spam attack from being too permissive too soon.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Your Spam Rate" icon="chart-line">
    **Track spam to know if filters are working**

    **Key metrics:**

    - Spam rate: % of reviews marked as spam
    - False positive rate: % of spam that should have been approved
    - Manual moderation time: Hours per week
    - Auto-publish rate: % of reviews auto-approved

    **Good spam rate:**

    - less than 5% spam = Excellent (filters working)
    - 5-10% spam = Good (normal level)
    - 10-20% spam = High (tighten filters)
    - 20%+ spam = Crisis (major filter issue)

    **If spam increasing:**

    1. Check spam folder for patterns
    2. Identify common spam sources (emails, IPs)
    3. Add to blacklist
    4. Tighten auto-publish rules
    5. Enable email verification

    **If spam too low (with high false positives):**

    1. Filters may be too strict
    2. Check spam folder for legitimate reviews
    3. Loosen keyword filters
    4. Adjust profanity sensitivity
    5. Review false positive patterns

    **Monthly review:**

    - Export spam reviews to spreadsheet
    - Look for patterns
    - Adjust filters accordingly
    - Track improvement
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Blacklists Strategically" icon="ban">
    **Block repeat offenders, not entire categories**

    **Email blacklist:**

    - Add specific spam email addresses
    - Block disposable email domains
    - Blacklist competitor domains (optional)

    **Don't blacklist:**

    - Entire email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)
    - Customer who left one negative review
    - Domains used legitimately

    → [Email blacklist guide](/managing-reviews/email-blacklist)

    **Product blacklist:**

    - Temporarily blacklist new products (manual review first 30 days)
    - Blacklist problematic products (quality issues)
    - Remove from blacklist once stable

    **Don't blacklist:**

    - Products permanently (defeats auto-publish)
    - Products just because they get negative reviews
    - All products (use manual moderation instead)

    → [Product blacklist guide](/managing-reviews/product-blacklist)

    **Best practice:** Blacklists are for exceptions, not rules. Use sparingly and review quarterly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Respond Before Moderating Negatives" icon="reply">
    **Address concerns privately, then decide on publishing**

    **Workflow for negative reviews:**

    1. Negative review in pending
    2. Read carefully
    3. Contact customer privately via email
    4. Offer solution, apology, replacement
    5. THEN decide: Approve with reply, or resolve privately

    **Example:**

    - Customer: "Product broke after 2 days" (2-star review)
    - You (email): "So sorry! This isn't typical. We'll send replacement immediately + 20% refund. Can we make this right?"
    - Customer: "Yes, thank you!"
    - You: Approve review with public reply: "We're sorry about this issue and have sent a replacement. We stand behind our quality."
    - OR: Customer updates to 5-star after resolution

    **Why this works:**

    - You resolve the issue
    - Customer often updates review or doesn't mind it being public
    - Your public reply shows you care
    - Other customers see you fix problems

    **Don't:**

    - Hide legitimate complaints without addressing
    - Approve negative reviews without responding
    - Only publish positive reviews (looks suspicious)

    <Check>
      **Best practice:** Reply to ALL negative reviews before approving. Show you care publicly. This turns negative reviews into trust builders.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Start with "hold for manual review" for profanity and spam. After 30 days, you'll understand your false positive rate and can switch to more aggressive auto-hide if filters are working well.
