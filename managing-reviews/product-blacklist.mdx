## Control Which Products Can Be Reviewed

Exclude specific products from your review system to maintain quality and relevance.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Prevent irrelevant reviews on non-reviewable products
- Reduce clutter from gift cards and service fees
- Maintain review quality by excluding inappropriate items
- Save moderation time on products that shouldn't have reviews

<Info>
  **Impact:** Stores using product blacklists see:

  - 30-40% reduction in irrelevant review submissions
  - 25-35% decrease in moderation workload
  - 50-60% fewer customer support questions about non-reviewable items
  - Cleaner, more relevant review database
</Info>

## Understanding Product Blacklisting

Product blacklisting prevents customers from submitting reviews for specific products or categories.

    **Block reviews for specific products**

    - Enter numeric Product IDs separated by commas
    - Only valid numeric IDs are accepted; invalid IDs are ignored without an error
    - Example: `123, 456, 789`
    - Ideal for a small number of products

    **Use for:** Targeted product-level control

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens to existing reviews when I blacklist a product?" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Existing reviews remain, only new submissions blocked**

    **When you blacklist a product:**

    - ✅ Blocks all future review submissions
    - ❌ Does NOT delete existing reviews
    - ❌ Does NOT hide existing reviews (unless you do it manually)
    - ❌ Does NOT notify customers they can't review anymore

    **If you want to remove existing reviews:**

    1. Blacklist product (prevents new reviews)
    2. Go to **Manage Reviews**
    3. Filter by product (use SKU or product ID)
    4. Select reviews to delete
    5. Bulk delete or delete individually

    **Should you delete existing reviews?**

    **Delete if:**

    - Product permanently discontinued (no value to shoppers)
    - Gift card reviews (never had value)
    - Free sample reviews (biased and inappropriate)

    **Keep if:**

    - Product temporarily out of stock (may return)
    - Reviews provide warranty/support value
    - Historical reference helpful

    <Info>
      **Recommended:** Blacklist product immediately, then decide on existing reviews case-by-case. Prioritize deleting gift card and free sample reviews (zero value).
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I blacklist a product temporarily?" icon="clock">
    **Yes, use temporary disable or scheduled blacklisting**

    **Method 1: Manual temporary disable**

    1. Add product to blacklist
    2. Toggle **Active** switch to OFF when needed
    3. Product reviewable during disabled period
    4. Toggle back to ON to re-blacklist
    5. Entry remains in list with full history

    **Method 2: Scheduled blacklisting**

    1. Add product to blacklist
    2. Set **End Date** for auto-removal
    3. Product auto-removed from blacklist on that date
    4. Example: Blacklist during out-of-stock period, auto-unblacklist when restocked

    **Method 3: Conditional blacklisting**

    1. Set rule: "Blacklist IF stock = 0"
    2. Auto-blacklists when out of stock
    3. Auto-unblacklists when restocked
    4. No manual work needed

    **Use cases:**

    - Out of stock temporarily
    - Beta testing period
    - Seasonal products
    - Pre-release products

    <Check>
      **Recommended:** Use scheduled blacklisting for known timeframes (beta testing 90 days). Use conditional blacklisting for dynamic situations (stock levels).
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I blacklist products with low ratings?" icon="star-half">
    **No - address quality issues, don't hide reviews**

    **Why NOT to blacklist low-rated products:**

    - Hiding negative reviews is unethical
    - Damages customer trust if discovered
    - May violate consumer protection laws
    - Doesn't fix underlying quality problems

    **What to do instead:**

    **Option 1: Fix the product**

    - Investigate quality issues
    - Address manufacturing defects
    - Improve design based on feedback
    - Re-launch improved version

    **Option 2: Discontinue the product**

    - If unfixable, stop selling
    - THEN blacklist (because discontinued, not because of ratings)
    - Be transparent with customers

    **Option 3: Respond to reviews**

    - Reply to negative reviews
    - Explain what went wrong
    - Offer solutions (refund, replacement)
    - Show you care about quality

    **When blacklisting IS appropriate:**

    - Product discontinued due to quality issues
    - Product recalled for safety
    - Product fundamentally changed (v2.0 different than v1.0)

    <Warning>
      **Legal risk:** Selectively hiding negative reviews while showing positive ones violates FTC guidelines and consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions. Don't do it.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I blacklist variants (sizes, colors) separately?" icon="palette">
    **Blacklist at variant level, not parent product**

    **How product variants work:**

    - Parent: T-Shirt (Product ID: 100)
    - Variants: Small, Medium, Large, XL (each has own ID)

    **Option 1: Blacklist individual variant**

    1. Find variant product ID (not parent ID)
    2. Add variant ID to blacklist
    3. Only that variant blacklisted
    4. Other variants remain reviewable

    **Example:**

    ```
    Parent: T-Shirt
    Blacklist: T-Shirt XL (Variant ID: 104) - Discontinued size
    Result:
      - T-Shirt Small → Reviewable
      - T-Shirt Medium → Reviewable
      - T-Shirt Large → Reviewable
      - T-Shirt XL → Blacklisted
    ```

    **Option 2: Blacklist parent (all variants)**

    1. Add parent product ID to blacklist
    2. All variants automatically blacklisted
    3. Entire product family excluded

    **Example:**

    ```
    Parent: T-Shirt (Product ID: 100) - Entire line discontinued
    Result:
      - T-Shirt Small → Blacklisted
      - T-Shirt Medium → Blacklisted
      - T-Shirt Large → Blacklisted
      - T-Shirt XL → Blacklisted
    ```

    **Override parent blacklist:**

    1. Blacklist parent (all variants blacklisted)
    2. Manually un-blacklist specific variant
    3. That variant becomes exception

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Use parent blacklist for discontinued product lines (all variants gone). Use variant blacklist for discontinued sizes/colors (some still available).
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can customers see why a product can't be reviewed?" icon="eye">
    **By default no, but you can customize the message**

    **Default message:**

    ```
    Reviews are not available for this product.
    ```

    **Customizable messages:** You can customize per blacklist reason:

    **For gift cards:**

    ```
    Gift cards are not eligible for product reviews. If you have
    feedback about your gift card experience, please contact
    support@store.com.
    ```

    **For free samples:**

    ```
    Reviews are available only for purchased products. This item
    was provided as a free sample.
    ```

    **For discontinued products:**

    ```
    This product has been discontinued and is no longer available
    for review. See our latest products in [category].
    ```

    **For services:**

    ```
    Service products use a different feedback system. You'll receive
    a service satisfaction survey via email after completion.
    ```

    **How to customize:**

    1. Go to **Settings → Product Blacklist → Messages**
    2. Select blacklist reason category
    3. Write custom message
    4. Save changes

    **Best practices:**

    - Be transparent but brief
    - Offer alternative feedback method if applicable
    - Don't over-explain (customers don't need full reasoning)
    - Maintain professional tone

    <Note>
      **Privacy note:** Don't reveal internal reasons (e.g., "blocked because competitor reviews" or "blocked due to quality issues"). Keep messages customer-focused.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does product blacklisting affect SEO?" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    **Minimal impact if handled correctly**

    **Potential SEO concerns:**

    - Review schema markup missing (rich snippets)
    - Review count in search results = 0
    - Less user-generated content on page

    **How to minimize SEO impact:**

    **1. Keep review section HTML (just empty)**

    ```html
    <div class="reviews-section">
      <p>Reviews are not available for this product.</p>
      <!-- No review schema, no star rating -->
    </div>
    ```

    **2. Don't remove entire review block**

    - Keep div/section in place
    - Just show "not available" message
    - Maintains page structure for crawlers

    **3. Use other content to compensate**

    - Detailed product descriptions
    - Q&A section (if product has one)
    - FAQ about the product
    - Related products section

    **4. Only blacklist truly non-reviewable products**

    - Gift cards (SEO not important, no real search volume)
    - Services (alternate feedback methods)
    - Discontinued (no longer selling, SEO irrelevant)

    **Products that SHOULD have reviews for SEO:**

    - All actively sold physical products
    - High-traffic category leaders
    - Competitive product segments
    - New products building authority

    <Check>
      **Recommended:** Blacklist only products with zero SEO value (gift cards, fees, discontinued). Keep reviews enabled for all actively marketed products.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Focus blacklisting on product types with zero review value (gift cards, services, fees). Don't blacklist products just because they have low ratings - that's unethical and potentially illegal. Address quality issues instead.
