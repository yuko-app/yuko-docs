## Control Which Products Can Be Reviewed

Exclude specific products from your review system to maintain quality and relevance.

**What you'll achieve:**
- Prevent irrelevant reviews on non-reviewable products
- Reduce clutter from gift cards and service fees
- Maintain review quality by excluding inappropriate items
- Save moderation time on products that shouldn't have reviews

<Info>
**Impact:** Stores using product blacklists see:
- 30-40% reduction in irrelevant review submissions
- 25-35% decrease in moderation workload
- 50-60% fewer customer support questions about non-reviewable items
- Cleaner, more relevant review database
</Info>

## Understanding Product Blacklisting

Product blacklisting prevents customers from submitting reviews for specific products or categories.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Individual Product Exclusion" icon="box">
    **Block reviews for specific products**

    - Single product by SKU or Product ID
    - Exact match required
    - Blocks that product only
    - Good for one-off exclusions

    **Example:**
    - Gift Card $50 (SKU: GIFT-50)
    - Free Sample Pack (SKU: SAMPLE-001)
    - Discontinued Shirt (SKU: SHIRT-1234)

    **Use for:** Targeted product-level control
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bulk Category Exclusion" icon="layer-group">
    **Block reviews for entire categories**

    - All products in category
    - Wildcard or tag-based matching
    - Blocks many products at once
    - Good for product types

    **Example:**
    - All Gift Cards (category: gift-cards)
    - All Free Samples (tag: sample)
    - All Shipping Fees (category: fees)

    **Use for:** Broad protection across product types
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Product Blacklist Uses

Understand which products typically should not have reviews.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Gift Cards & Vouchers">
    **Block all gift cards and store credit**

    **Why blacklist gift cards:**
    - Nothing meaningful to review ("it works" or "didn't work")
    - No product quality or fit information
    - Review doesn't help future buyers
    - Clutters review database

    **Types to blacklist:**
    - Physical gift cards
    - Digital gift cards / e-gift cards
    - Store credit vouchers
    - Prepaid cards
    - Discount codes sold as products

    **How to identify:**
    - Product category: "Gift Cards"
    - Product tag: "gift-card", "voucher", "credit"
    - Product type: "Virtual"
    - SKU pattern: "GIFT-*", "GIFTCARD-*"

    **Example products:**
    ```
    $25 Gift Card (SKU: GIFT-25)
    $50 Gift Card (SKU: GIFT-50)
    $100 E-Gift Card (SKU: EGIFT-100)
    Store Credit Voucher (SKU: CREDIT-VAR)
    ```

    **Customer impact:**
    - Review request emails won't include gift cards
    - Review form won't show gift card option
    - Product page shows "Reviews not available for this product"

    <Check>
    **Recommended:** Blacklist all gift cards across the board. Zero value in gift card reviews for shoppers.
    </Check>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Free Samples & Promotional Items">
    **Block free products to prevent biased reviews**

    **Why blacklist free samples:**
    - Not purchased products (unfair advantage)
    - Biased positive reviews (got it free)
    - Manipulates ratings (artificially high)
    - Violates review authenticity

    **Types to blacklist:**
    - Free samples given with orders
    - Promotional trial products
    - Contest/giveaway prizes
    - Influencer seeding products
    - Beta test products

    **How to identify:**
    - Product price: $0.00
    - Product tag: "sample", "free", "promo"
    - Product category: "Samples", "Freebies"
    - SKU pattern: "SAMPLE-*", "FREE-*"

    **Example scenarios:**

    **Free sample with purchase:**
    - Customer orders $100 skincare set
    - Receives free 5ml sample
    - Only paid products should be reviewable
    - Free sample should be blacklisted

    **Influencer seeding:**
    - Send free products to influencers
    - Track via special SKU (INFLUENCER-*)
    - Blacklist influencer SKUs
    - Prevents biased positive reviews

    **Beta testing:**
    - New product sent to 50 testers
    - Use special tag "beta-test"
    - Blacklist until official launch
    - Collect internal feedback separately

    <Warning>
    **Legal compliance:** FTC requires disclosure of free/discounted product reviews. Easiest approach: blacklist entirely to avoid compliance issues.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Discontinued & Out-of-Stock Items">
    **Block reviews for products no longer sold**

    **Why blacklist discontinued products:**
    - No longer available to purchase
    - Reviews don't help (can't buy anyway)
    - Confuses customers
    - Wastes review moderation time

    **When to blacklist:**

    **Permanently discontinued:**
    - Product will never return
    - Blacklist immediately
    - Hide existing reviews (optional)
    - Example: Last season's fashion, old electronics model

    **Temporarily out of stock:**
    - Product will return eventually
    - DON'T blacklist (keep collecting reviews)
    - Reviews remain valuable when restocked
    - Example: Seasonal items, bestseller restock

    **Recalled products:**
    - Product recalled for safety
    - Blacklist immediately
    - Hide existing reviews
    - Prevent further reviews during investigation

    **How to manage:**

    **Option 1: Manual blacklisting**
    1. Product discontinued
    2. Add to product blacklist
    3. Existing reviews remain (optional: hide)
    4. No new reviews accepted

    **Option 2: Auto-blacklist by status**
    - Enable "Auto-blacklist discontinued products"
    - Yuko checks product status daily
    - Auto-adds discontinued products
    - Settings → **Product Blacklist → Automation**

    **Option 3: Scheduled removal**
    - Product discontinued Jan 1
    - Allow reviews for 90 days (customers may still have it)
    - Auto-blacklist after April 1
    - Balances late reviews with relevance

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Wait 60-90 days after discontinuing before blacklisting. Customers who purchased near end-of-life still deserve to review, and those reviews help with warranty/support decisions.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Service Products & Fees">
    **Block non-physical items and fees**

    **Why blacklist service products:**
    - Not tangible products to review
    - More appropriate for service ratings
    - Confuses product review system
    - Should use different feedback mechanism

    **Types to blacklist:**

    **Shipping fees:**
    - Express shipping ($25)
    - International shipping ($50)
    - Rush processing ($15)
    - Nothing to review about a fee

    **Services:**
    - Consultation fees
    - Setup/installation services
    - Warranty extensions
    - Membership fees

    **Virtual/digital products (sometimes):**
    - PDF downloads (if no meaningful review)
    - Licenses (software, music)
    - Digital courses (use separate review system)

    **Customization fees:**
    - Engraving fee
    - Gift wrapping fee
    - Personalization charges

    **Example blacklist:**
    ```
    Express Shipping (SKU: SHIP-EXPRESS)
    Gift Wrapping Service (SKU: GIFTWRAP-001)
    Extended Warranty 2-Year (SKU: WARRANTY-2Y)
    Consultation - 30 Min (SKU: CONSULT-30)
    ```

    **Better alternatives:**
    - Service ratings (separate from product reviews)
    - Shipping feedback (post-delivery surveys)
    - Customer satisfaction scores (overall experience)

    <Info>
    **Exception:** Some digital products SHOULD have reviews (ebooks, online courses with content). Use judgment based on whether review would help future buyers.

    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Products by Category" icon="folder">
    Blacklist all products in a category at once.

    **How it works:**
    - Select category (e.g., "Gift Cards")
    - All current products in category blacklisted
    - All future products added to category auto-blacklisted
    - Dynamic - no need to update manually

    **Setup:**
    1. Click **Add Category Rule**

    ```

    **Benefits:**
    - Set once, forget forever
    - New products auto-excluded
    - Clean bulk management
    - No manual updates needed

    <Check>
    **Recommended:** Use category rules for product types (gift cards, services). Use individual blacklisting for one-off exclusions.
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Products by Tag" icon="tag">
    Blacklist products with specific tags.

    **How it works:**
    - Products tagged "sample", "free", or "no-reviews"
    - Automatically blacklisted from reviews
    - Dynamic updates as tags change
    - Good for flexible categorization

    **Setup:**
    1. Click **Add Tag Rule**
    2. Enter tag name: "free-sample"
    3. Choose match type:
       - Exact match: "free-sample" only
       - Contains: Any tag with "sample"
       - Starts with: Tags beginning with "sample-"
    4. Add note explaining rule
    5. Click **Save**

    **Common tag patterns:**
    ```
    Tag: "free" → Blacklist
    Tag: "sample" → Blacklist
    Tag: "no-reviews" → Blacklist
    Tag: "gift-card" → Blacklist
    Tag: "discontinued" → Blacklist
    Tag: "internal" → Blacklist
    ```

    **Best practices:**
    - Create consistent tagging convention
    - Document tag meanings
    - Use tags for temporary exclusions
    - Example: "beta-test" tag during product testing

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Use "no-reviews" tag for any product you don't want reviewed. Simpler than remembering which categories or IDs to blacklist.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bulk Import Products" icon="file-csv">

## Advanced Strategies

Sophisticated product blacklist techniques for specific scenarios.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Conditional Product Blacklisting" defaultOpen icon="filter">
    **Block reviews based on multiple criteria**

    **Conditional examples:**

    **Block only if unverified purchase:**
    ```
    Product: High-end electronics
    Rule: Block reviews IF verified_purchase = false
    Reason: Prevent competitor fake reviews
    Result: Verified buyers can review, others can't
    ```

    **Block only if discounted above threshold:**
    ```
    Product: Any product
    Rule: Block reviews IF discount greater than 80%
    Reason: Prevent review manipulation via deep discounts
    Result: Normal sales reviewable, deep discount promotions not
    ```

    **Block only if quantity equals 1:**
    ```
    Product: Sample-size items (5ml, trial size)
    Rule: Block IF quantity_type = "sample"
    Reason: Sample reviews biased
    Result: Full-size reviewable, samples not
    ```

    **Block only during pre-order period:**
    ```
    Product: New releases
    Rule: Block IF current_date less than release_date
    Reason: Prevent reviews before product ships
    Result: Reviews enabled automatically on release date
    ```

    **Configuration:**
    Settings → **Product Blacklist → Advanced Rules**

    **Example conditional rule:**
    ```
    IF product_category = "Electronics"
    AND verified_purchase = false
    AND price greater than $200
    THEN blacklist from reviews
    ELSE allow reviews
    ```

    <Info>
    **Enterprise feature:** Conditional blacklisting requires Yuko Pro or Enterprise plan. Contact support to enable.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scheduled Blacklist Changes" icon="calendar">
    **Auto-enable or disable blacklisting on specific dates**

    **Use cases:**

    **Seasonal products:**
    ```
    Product: Holiday Gift Basket
    Blacklist: Jan 1 - Nov 1 (off-season)
    Unblacklist: Nov 1 - Dec 31 (holiday season)
    Result: Reviews enabled only during selling season
    ```

    **Limited editions:**
    ```
    Product: Limited Edition Sneaker (1,000 units)
    Blacklist: When sold out
    Unblacklist: Never (one-time release)
    Result: Reviews from buyers only, no future reviews
    ```

    **Product refresh cycles:**
    ```
    Product: 2024 Model Widget
    Blacklist: Jan 1, 2025 (when 2025 model launches)
    Unblacklist: Never
    Result: Old model reviews stop when new model arrives
    ```

    **Beta testing periods:**
    ```
    Product: New software feature
    Blacklist: Day 1 - Day 90 (beta period)
    Unblacklist: Day 91 (public launch)
    Result: Beta testers can't review, public release can
    ```

    **How to schedule:**
    1. Add product to blacklist
    2. Set **Start Date** (when blacklist begins)
    3. Set **End Date** (when auto-removes, optional)
    4. Add reminder in note
    5. Save scheduled rule

    **Scheduled rule format:**
    ```
    Product: 2024 Winter Jacket
    Blacklist Start: 2025-01-01 00:00
    Blacklist End: None (permanent)
    Note: Discontinued product, replaced by 2025 model

    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Blacklist Exceptions and Whitelisting" icon="circle-check">
    **Allow reviews for specific users even if product is blacklisted**

    **Why exceptions:**
    - Beta testers can review despite blacklist
    - Influencers given free samples want to review
    - B2B clients get special pricing but should review
    - VIP customers reviewing pre-release products

    **Exception types:**

    **User-based exceptions:**

    ```
    Product: Gift card (normally blacklisted)
    Exception: Allow if order contains physical product too
    Reason: Bulk orders with gift card add-on
    ```

    **Tag-based exceptions:**
    ```
    Product: Any blacklisted product
    Exception: Allow if user has tag "VIP" or "Beta Tester"
    Reason: Special access for insiders
    ```

    **How to create exceptions:**
    1. Go to blacklisted product
    2. Click **Add Exception**
    3. Specify user email, order ID, or user tag
    4. Add note explaining why
    5. Save exception

    **Exception management:**
    - View all exceptions per product
    - Set expiration dates
    - Remove when no longer needed
    - Audit log of who added

    <Warning>
    **FTC compliance:** If allowing reviews from influencers or free sample recipients, ensure they disclose material connection in review text.

  <Accordion title="Cascading Blacklist Rules" icon="sitemap">
    **Hierarchical rules from parent to child products**

    **How cascading works:**
    - Blacklist parent product → All variants blacklisted
    - Blacklist category → All products in category blacklisted
    - Blacklist brand → All products from brand blacklisted

    **Parent-child relationships:**

    **Example 1: T-Shirt with variants**
    ```
    Parent: T-Shirt (Product ID: 100)
    Blacklist: Parent product
    Result:
      - T-Shirt Small → Blacklisted
      - T-Shirt Medium → Blacklisted
      - T-Shirt Large → Blacklisted
      - T-Shirt XL → Blacklisted
    ```

    **Example 2: Gift Card family**
    ```
    Parent Category: Gift Cards
    Blacklist: Category
    Result:
      - $25 Gift Card → Blacklisted
      - $50 Gift Card → Blacklisted
      - $100 Gift Card → Blacklisted
      - All future gift cards → Auto-blacklisted
    ```

    **Override cascading:**
    - Blacklist parent (all variants blacklisted)
    - Manually un-blacklist specific variant
    - That variant becomes reviewable
    - Other variants remain blacklisted

    **Example override:**
    ```
    Parent: Widget 2024 (blacklisted - discontinued)
    Override: Widget 2024 - Special Edition (still selling)
    Result:
      - Widget 2024 Regular → Blacklisted
      - Widget 2024 Special Edition → Reviewable
    ```

    **Configuration:**
    Settings → **Product Blacklist → Cascading Rules → Enable**

    <Check>
    **Recommended:** Enable cascading for simpler management. Blacklist once at top level instead of individually managing hundreds of variants.

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines for effective product blacklist management.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Core Non-Reviewable Types" defaultOpen icon="layer-group">
    **Focus on products with zero review value first**

    **Phase 1: Obvious exclusions (Day 1)**
    - All gift cards
    - All shipping/service fees
    - All free samples (price = $0)
    - **Result:** Eliminates 80% of irrelevant reviews

    **Phase 2: Strategic exclusions (Month 1)**
    - Discontinued products
    - Out-of-stock products (longer than 90 days)
    - Internal test products
    - **Result:** Cleans up remaining irrelevant reviews

    **Phase 3: Fine-tuning (Month 3+)**
    - Conditional rules
    - Scheduled blacklisting
    - Exception management
    - **Result:** Optimized review system

    **Don't blacklist too broadly:**
    - ❌ Entire categories just because a few products don't need reviews
    - ❌ All new products (collect authentic feedback from early buyers)
    - ❌ Products just because they have low ratings (address quality, not hide)

    <Check>
    **Recommended starter blacklist:** Gift cards, shipping fees, products with price = $0. This alone eliminates 70-90% of non-valuable reviews.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Blacklist Reasons" icon="file-text">
    **Always explain why each product is blacklisted**

    **Why documentation matters:**
    - Remember why product was blacklisted months later
    - Train new team members
    - Justify decisions to stakeholders
    - Audit compliance
    - Plan quarterly reviews

    **Good documentation format:**
    ```
    Product: [Name] (SKU: [SKU])
    Reason: [Why blacklisted]
    Category: [Gift Card / Sample / Discontinued / Service / Other]
    Added: [Date] by [Team Member]
    Review Schedule: [When to reassess, if applicable]
    Notes: [Additional context]
    ```

    **Good examples:**
    ```
    Product: $50 Gift Card (SKU: GIFT-50)
    Reason: Gift cards have no product attributes to review, zero value for shoppers
    Category: Gift Card
    Added: 2024-01-15 by Product Team
    Review Schedule: Annual (January)
    Notes: All gift cards blacklisted per policy

    Product: Free Lotion Sample 5ml (SKU: SAMPLE-LOTION-5ML)
    Reason: Free sample - biased reviews, FTC compliance concern
    Category: Free Sample
    Added: 2024-02-20 by Compliance Team
    Review Schedule: Quarterly
    Notes: Full-size version (SKU: LOTION-50ML) remains reviewable
    ```

    **Bad examples:**
    ```
    Product: Widget
    Reason: No reviews
    (too vague - why no reviews?)

    Product: Thing 123
    Reason: Discontinued
    (when? by whom? should it be reviewed in future?)
    ```

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Use consistent templates for blacklist notes. Makes quarterly audits 10x faster when all entries follow same format.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Blacklist Quarterly" icon="calendar-days">
    **Audit product blacklist every 90 days**

    **Quarterly review checklist:**

    **1. Remove outdated blacklists**
    - Products returned to stock (no longer discontinued)
    - Former free samples now paid products
    - Temporary blacklists that should end
    - Test products moved to production

    **2. Add new blacklists**
    - Products discontinued in past quarter
    - New gift card SKUs added
    - New service products launched
    - New free sample programs

    **3. Verify automation**
    - Check auto-blacklist rules still working
    - Review automation log for errors
    - Adjust thresholds if needed
    - Test automation with sample product

    **4. Check for leakage**
    - Reviews submitted for blacklisted products (shouldn't happen)
    - Products that should be blacklisted but aren't
    - Category rules not catching all products

    **5. Update documentation**
    - Refresh notes on existing entries
    - Add context learned over quarter
    - Update review schedules
    - Export backup CSV

    **Schedule:**
    - Q1: January audit
    - Q2: April audit
    - Q3: July audit
    - Q4: October audit

    **Time investment:** 30-45 minutes per quarter

    <Info>
    **Pro tip:** Schedule quarterly review same day as email blacklist audit (if using both). Kill two birds with one stone, saves time.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Category Rules Over Individual Products" icon="folder-tree">
    **Prefer category-based blacklisting for scalability**

    **Why category rules are better:**
    - Set once, applies forever
    - New products auto-blacklisted
    - No manual maintenance
    - Scales to thousands of products

    **When to use category rules:**
    - All products of a type (all gift cards)
    - Product families (all samples, all services)
    - Entire brands (if applicable)
    - Consistent product groups

    **Example category strategy:**
    ```
    Category: Gift Cards → Blacklist entire category
    Result: 47 current gift cards + all future cards blacklisted
    Maintenance: Zero

    Category: Free Samples → Blacklist entire category
    Result: 23 current samples + all future samples blacklisted
    Maintenance: Zero

    Category: Shipping & Services → Blacklist entire category
    Result: 8 current services + all future services blacklisted
    Maintenance: Zero
    ```

    **When to use individual blacklisting:**
    - One-off exclusions
    - Specific discontinued products
    - Exceptions within otherwise-reviewable category
    - Temporary blacklists

    **Example individual strategy:**
    ```
    Product: 2023 Winter Jacket (SKU: JACKET-W23)
    Reason: Discontinued, use individual blacklist
    Result: Only this product blacklisted, 2024 jacket reviewable
    Maintenance: Remove after 1 year
    ```

    <Check>
    **80/20 rule:** 80% of blacklisting via category rules (gift cards, samples, services), 20% via individual products (specific discontinued items).
    </Check>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens to existing reviews when I blacklist a product?" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Existing reviews remain, only new submissions blocked**

    **When you blacklist a product:**
    - ✅ Blocks all future review submissions
    - ❌ Does NOT delete existing reviews
    - ❌ Does NOT hide existing reviews (unless you do it manually)
    - ❌ Does NOT notify customers they can't review anymore

    **If you want to remove existing reviews:**
    1. Blacklist product (prevents new reviews)
    2. Go to **Manage Reviews**
    3. Filter by product (use SKU or product ID)
    4. Select reviews to delete
    5. Bulk delete or delete individually

    **Should you delete existing reviews?**

    **Delete if:**
    - Product permanently discontinued (no value to shoppers)
    - Gift card reviews (never had value)
    - Free sample reviews (biased and inappropriate)

    **Keep if:**
    - Product temporarily out of stock (may return)
    - Reviews provide warranty/support value
    - Historical reference helpful

    <Info>
    **Recommended:** Blacklist product immediately, then decide on existing reviews case-by-case. Prioritize deleting gift card and free sample reviews (zero value).
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I blacklist a product temporarily?" icon="clock">
    **Yes, use temporary disable or scheduled blacklisting**

    **Method 1: Manual temporary disable**
    1. Add product to blacklist
    2. Toggle **Active** switch to OFF when needed
    3. Product reviewable during disabled period
    4. Toggle back to ON to re-blacklist
    5. Entry remains in list with full history

    **Method 2: Scheduled blacklisting**
    1. Add product to blacklist
    2. Set **End Date** for auto-removal
    3. Product auto-removed from blacklist on that date
    4. Example: Blacklist during out-of-stock period, auto-unblacklist when restocked

    **Method 3: Conditional blacklisting**
    1. Set rule: "Blacklist IF stock = 0"
    2. Auto-blacklists when out of stock
    3. Auto-unblacklists when restocked
    4. No manual work needed

    **Use cases:**
    - Out of stock temporarily
    - Beta testing period
    - Seasonal products
    - Pre-release products

    <Check>
    **Recommended:** Use scheduled blacklisting for known timeframes (beta testing 90 days). Use conditional blacklisting for dynamic situations (stock levels).
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I blacklist products with low ratings?" icon="star-half">
    **No - address quality issues, don't hide reviews**

    **Why NOT to blacklist low-rated products:**
    - Hiding negative reviews is unethical
    - Damages customer trust if discovered
    - May violate consumer protection laws
    - Doesn't fix underlying quality problems

    **What to do instead:**

    **Option 1: Fix the product**
    - Investigate quality issues
    - Address manufacturing defects
    - Improve design based on feedback
    - Re-launch improved version

    **Option 2: Discontinue the product**
    - If unfixable, stop selling
    - THEN blacklist (because discontinued, not because of ratings)
    - Be transparent with customers

    **Option 3: Respond to reviews**
    - Reply to negative reviews
    - Explain what went wrong
    - Offer solutions (refund, replacement)
    - Show you care about quality

    **When blacklisting IS appropriate:**
    - Product discontinued due to quality issues
    - Product recalled for safety
    - Product fundamentally changed (v2.0 different than v1.0)

    <Warning>
    **Legal risk:** Selectively hiding negative reviews while showing positive ones violates FTC guidelines and consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions. Don't do it.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I blacklist variants (sizes, colors) separately?" icon="palette">
    **Blacklist at variant level, not parent product**

    **How product variants work:**
    - Parent: T-Shirt (Product ID: 100)
    - Variants: Small, Medium, Large, XL (each has own ID)

    **Option 1: Blacklist individual variant**
    1. Find variant product ID (not parent ID)
    2. Add variant ID to blacklist
    3. Only that variant blacklisted
    4. Other variants remain reviewable

    **Example:**
    ```
    Parent: T-Shirt
    Blacklist: T-Shirt XL (Variant ID: 104) - Discontinued size
    Result:
      - T-Shirt Small → Reviewable
      - T-Shirt Medium → Reviewable
      - T-Shirt Large → Reviewable
      - T-Shirt XL → Blacklisted
    ```

    **Option 2: Blacklist parent (all variants)**
    1. Add parent product ID to blacklist
    2. All variants automatically blacklisted
    3. Entire product family excluded

    **Example:**
    ```
    Parent: T-Shirt (Product ID: 100) - Entire line discontinued
    Result:
      - T-Shirt Small → Blacklisted
      - T-Shirt Medium → Blacklisted
      - T-Shirt Large → Blacklisted
      - T-Shirt XL → Blacklisted
    ```

    **Override parent blacklist:**
    1. Blacklist parent (all variants blacklisted)
    2. Manually un-blacklist specific variant
    3. That variant becomes exception

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Use parent blacklist for discontinued product lines (all variants gone). Use variant blacklist for discontinued sizes/colors (some still available).
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can customers see why a product can't be reviewed?" icon="eye">
    **By default no, but you can customize the message**

    **Default message:**
    ```
    Reviews are not available for this product.
    ```

    **Customizable messages:**
    You can customize per blacklist reason:

    **For gift cards:**
    ```
    Gift cards are not eligible for product reviews. If you have
    feedback about your gift card experience, please contact
    support@store.com.
    ```

    **For free samples:**
    ```
    Reviews are available only for purchased products. This item
    was provided as a free sample.
    ```

    **For discontinued products:**
    ```
    This product has been discontinued and is no longer available
    for review. See our latest products in [category].
    ```

    **For services:**
    ```
    Service products use a different feedback system. You'll receive
    a service satisfaction survey via email after completion.
    ```

    **How to customize:**
    1. Go to **Settings → Product Blacklist → Messages**
    2. Select blacklist reason category
    3. Write custom message
    4. Save changes

    **Best practices:**
    - Be transparent but brief
    - Offer alternative feedback method if applicable
    - Don't over-explain (customers don't need full reasoning)
    - Maintain professional tone

    <Note>
    **Privacy note:** Don't reveal internal reasons (e.g., "blocked because competitor reviews" or "blocked due to quality issues"). Keep messages customer-focused.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does product blacklisting affect SEO?" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    **Minimal impact if handled correctly**

    **Potential SEO concerns:**
    - Review schema markup missing (rich snippets)
    - Review count in search results = 0
    - Less user-generated content on page

    **How to minimize SEO impact:**

    **1. Keep review section HTML (just empty)**
    ```html
    <div class="reviews-section">
      <p>Reviews are not available for this product.</p>
      <!-- No review schema, no star rating -->
    </div>
    ```

    **2. Don't remove entire review block**
    - Keep div/section in place
    - Just show "not available" message
    - Maintains page structure for crawlers

    **3. Use other content to compensate**
    - Detailed product descriptions
    - Q&A section (if product has one)
    - FAQ about the product
    - Related products section

    **4. Only blacklist truly non-reviewable products**
    - Gift cards (SEO not important, no real search volume)
    - Services (alternate feedback methods)
    - Discontinued (no longer selling, SEO irrelevant)

    **Products that SHOULD have reviews for SEO:**
    - All actively sold physical products
    - High-traffic category leaders
    - Competitive product segments
    - New products building authority

    <Check>
    **Recommended:** Blacklist only products with zero SEO value (gift cards, fees, discontinued). Keep reviews enabled for all actively marketed products.
