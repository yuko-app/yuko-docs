Review Restrictions & Limits help you control **who can submit reviews**, **what information is collected**, and **which users or products are excluded**. These settings are designed to prevent spam, protect customer privacy, and maintain review quality.

**YUKO Dashboard → Settings → Reviews → General → Review Restrictions & Limits**

### Settings:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who Can Write a Review" icon="sparkles">
    This setting controls **who is allowed to submit reviews** on your store.\
    \
    **How It Works:**

    You can choose between:

    - **Anyone** – Allows all visitors to submit reviews
    - **Only buyers who have received a review request email and API users** – Restricts reviews to customers you explicitly invite

    When restricted, only customers who receive a review request email or submit reviews via the API can leave a review.

    ### Common Use Cases

    - Preventing fake or unverified reviews
    - Ensuring all reviews come from real customers
    - Maintaining higher review trust and credibility

    ### Best Practices

    - Use **review request–only submissions** for maximum authenticity
    - Combine with Email Blacklist for strong spam prevention

  <Accordion title="Product Blacklist">
    The Product Blacklist lets you exclude specific products from review workflows.\
    \
    **Where to Find the Product Blacklist:**

    There are **two ways** to access and manage the Product Blacklist.

    **Option 1: From Review Restrictions & Limits**

    **Navigation:**\
    \
    **YUKO Dashboard → Settings → Reviews → General → Review Restrictions & Limits**

    ![Op1](/images/op1.png)

    Under **Product Blacklist**, click **Manage Product Blacklist**.

    This button redirects you to the dedicated **Product Blacklist** page, where you can manage excluded products.

    > 📝 **Note:** This option exists for quick access while configuring review restrictions.

    **Option 2: Direct Access**

    \
    **Navigation:**

    **YUKO Dashboard → Reviews → Product Blacklist**

    ![Sf](/images/sf.png)

    This page provides full control over excluded products and supports bulk management options.

    ### How Product Blacklist Works

    - Blacklisted products **will not receive review request emails**
    - Manual review requests are also skipped for these products
    - Existing reviews are **not removed**
    - Removing a product from the blacklist immediately restores review requests

    > 📝 **Note:** Product Blacklist affects review **collection**, not review display.

    ### Add Products to the Blacklist

    You can exclude products using **either** of the following methods.

    <Columns cols={2}>
      <Card title="Add Products Manually" icon="sparkles">
        \
        Click **Add Manually** to exclude products by entering their product IDs.

        #### How it works:

        - Enter **numeric product IDs** in the input field
        - Separate multiple IDs with commas
        - Only valid numeric product IDs are accepted

        \*\*Example: 123, 456,789 \*\*

        #### Important notes:

        - Invalid or non-numeric IDs are **ignored silently**
        - No error message is shown for invalid entries
        - Make sure all product IDs entered exist in your store

        <Tip>
          **Tip:** Always double-check product IDs before saving to avoid accidental exclusions.
        </Tip>
      </Card>
      <Card title="Upload Products via CSV" icon="sparkles">
        \
        For bulk exclusions, click **Upload CSV**.

        #### How it works:

        - Upload a CSV file containing product IDs you want to exclude
        - Each row should contain **one numeric product ID**
        - No column headers are required

        You can also click **Download sample CSV** to see the correct format before uploading.

        #### CSV requirements:

        - Numeric product IDs only
        - One product ID per row
        - Invalid product IDs will be skipped without an error

        <Tip>
          **Best Practice:** Use CSV upload when excluding a large number of products at once.

  <Accordion title="Email Blacklist">
    ## Email Blacklist

    The **Email Blacklist** allows you to exclude specific customers from receiving **all Yuko emails**, including:

    - Review request emails
    - Review reminder emails
    - Any future review-related communications

    This is useful for blocking internal team members, test accounts, support inboxes, or system-generated email addresses.

    ---

    ### Accessing the Email Blacklist

    **Navigation:**

    \
    **YUKO Dashboard → Settings → Account → Email Blacklist**

    ![Mn](/images/mn-2.png)

    From this page, you can manage all email addresses that should be excluded from Yuko email communications.

    ### How Email Blacklist Works

    - Blacklisted email addresses **will not receive any Yuko emails**
    - Applies to both automated and manual review requests
    - Works across all stores and products
    - Removing an email immediately re-enables email delivery

    > 📝 **Note:** Email Blacklist affects **email delivery only**. It does not remove existing reviews.

    ### Add Email Addresses to the Blacklist:

    You can add email addresses using **either** of the following methods.

    <Columns cols={2}>
      <Card title="Add Emails Manually" icon="sparkles">
        \
        Click **Add Manually** to exclude email addresses one by one or in bulk.

        #### How it works:

        - Enter email addresses in a **comma-separated format**
        - Wildcards (`*`) are supported to match patterns
        - Entries are case-insensitive

        #### Supported formats:

        **Block a single email address**

        ```
        sample@example.com
        ```

        **Block all emails from a specific domain**

        ```
        *@anydomain.com
        ```

        **Block emails starting with a specific prefix across all domains**

        ```
        no-reply@*
        ```

        #### Important notes:

        - Invalid email formats may be ignored without an error message
        - Make sure entries are formatted correctly before saving

        <Tip>
          **Best Practice:** Use wildcards carefully, as they can block a large number of email addresses.
        </Tip>
      </Card>
      <Card title="Upload Emails via CSV" icon="sparkles">
        \
        For bulk exclusions, click **Upload CSV**.

        #### How it works:

        - Upload a CSV file containing email addresses or wildcard patterns
        - Each row should contain **one email entry**
        - Wildcards (`*`) are supported in CSV uploads

        You can click **Download sample CSV** to see the correct format before uploading.

        #### CSV requirements:

        - One email or pattern per row
        - Maximum file size: **15 KB**
        - Invalid entries are skipped automatically

        <Tip>
          **Tip:** CSV upload is ideal when blocking large mailing lists, internal domains, or system-generated emails.
