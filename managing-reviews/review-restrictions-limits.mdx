<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Start with just 2-3 basic restrictions (personal info removal, 1 review per product, 5/day IP limit). Add more only if you encounter specific problems. Over-restricting costs more in lost reviews than it saves in prevented spam.
</Note>

**Next:** Learn how to use the **Email Blacklist** to block specific addresses and domains from submitting reviews.
