### Settings:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who Can Write a Review" icon="sparkles">
    This setting controls **who is allowed to submit reviews** on your store.\
    \
    **How It Works:**

    You can choose between:

    - **Anyone** – Allows all visitors to submit reviews
    - **Only buyers who have received a review request email and API users** – Restricts reviews to customers you explicitly invite

    When restricted, only customers who receive a review request email or submit reviews via the API can leave a review.

    ### Common Use Cases

    - Preventing fake or unverified reviews
    - Ensuring all reviews come from real customers
    - Maintaining higher review trust and credibility

    ### Best Practices

    - Use **review request–only submissions** for maximum authenticity
    - Combine with Email Blacklist for strong spam prevention

    \
    **How It Works:**

    When a product is blacklisted:

    - Automated review request emails are not sent

    - The product is excluded from review workflows

    Products are excluded using their **product ID**.

    **Common Use Cases**

    - Preventing reviews on internal or draft SKUs
    - Removing discontinued products from review collection

    **Best Practices**

## How These Settings Work Together

For the highest review quality and lowest spam risk:

1. Restrict reviews to invited customers
2. Hide the **Write a Review** button
3. Enable personal information restriction
4. Maintain an updated email blacklist

> ⭐ **Best Practice:** This configuration mirrors how most high-volume  merchants collect reviews.
