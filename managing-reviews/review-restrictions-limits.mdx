## Review Eligibility Restrictions

Control who is allowed to submit reviews on your products.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who Can Write a Review" defaultOpen icon="users">

    </Check>

    ![Reviewlim Pn](/images/reviewlim.png)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum Purchase Requirements" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Require minimum order value for review eligibility**

    **How it works:**
    - Only customers who spent above threshold can review
    - Prevents free sample/discount abuse reviews
    - Ensures reviewers have genuine financial stake

    **Threshold options:**
    - No minimum (default)
    - Greater than $0 (any paid purchase, excludes $0 test orders)
    - Greater than $10 (excludes very low-value items)
    - Greater than $25 (meaningful purchase threshold)
    - Custom amount

    **Use cases:**

    **Exclude free samples:**
    - Set minimum at $1 or $5
    - Prevents review manipulation via free products

    **Exclude deeply discounted orders:**
    - Set minimum at $15-$25
    - Reduces impact of 90%+ off review incentive abuse

    **B2B minimum orders:**
    - Set minimum at $50-$100
    - Ensures business buyers only

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Eligibility → Minimum Order Value**

    <Warning>
    **Trade-off:** Higher minimums reduce review volume. Only use when spam/manipulation is a real problem.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Email Verification Requirement" icon="envelope-circle-check">
    **Require customers to verify email before review publishes**

    **How email verification works:**
    1. Customer submits review
    2. Review status: "Pending Email Verification"
    3. Customer receives verification email
    4. Customer clicks verification link
    5. Review status changes to "Pending Approval" or "Published"

    **Benefits:**
    - Eliminates 90%+ of bot-submitted spam
    - Confirms real email addresses
    - Provides contact method for follow-up
    - Shows customer commitment (verified reviews = higher quality)

    **Drawbacks:**
    - Reduces review completion by 15-30%
    - Adds friction to review process
    - Some legitimate reviews lost (customers forget, ignore email)

    **When to enable:**
    - High spam environment (fashion, tech accessories)
    - Anonymous review submissions (not verified buyers)
    - After detecting review manipulation attempts

    **When to disable:**
    - Verified buyer-only reviews (already authenticated)
    - Low spam rates
    - Review volume is priority

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Eligibility → Require Email Verification**

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Enable email verification only for unverified buyers, not verified buyers who already authenticated during purchase.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Time Delay After Purchase" icon="clock">
    **Prevent reviews until X days after delivery**

    **How it works:**
    - Customer cannot submit review until delay period passes
    - Based on delivery date (if tracked) or order date
    - Prevents premature reviews before product use

    **Delay options:**
    - 0 days (immediate reviews allowed) - Default
    - 3 days (quick products - food, consumables)
    - 7 days (standard products - apparel, accessories)
    - 14 days (products requiring break-in - shoes, furniture)
    - 30 days (long-term products - appliances, tech)
    - Custom days

    **Use cases:**

    **Fashion/apparel:**
    - 7-day delay
    - Ensures customer wore/washed item
    - Reduces "looks great in box" premature 5-stars

    **Electronics:**
    - 14-30 day delay
    - Ensures proper setup and usage
    - Reduces "just opened, looks good" reviews

    **Furniture/appliances:**
    - 30-60 day delay
    - Ensures assembly and real-world use
    - Captures durability feedback

    **Consumables/food:**
    - 0-3 day delay
    - Products used quickly
    - Immediate feedback valuable

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Eligibility → Minimum Days Since Purchase**

    <Info>
    **Data shows:** 7-day delays increase average review rating accuracy by 15-20% for physical products, but reduce review volume by 10-15%.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Content Restrictions

Control what content customers can include in their reviews.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Personal Information Restriction" defaultOpen icon="user-lock">
    **Automatically remove emails, phone numbers, and addresses**

    **How auto-detection works:**
    Yuko scans review content for:
    - Email addresses (any format)
    - Phone numbers (all international formats)
    - Physical addresses
    - URLs (optional)
    - Payment information (credit cards, PayPal emails)

    **When detected, Yuko:**
    - **Option 1: Redact automatically** (replace with [removed])
    - **Option 2: Hold review for manual review** (flag for moderation)
    - **Option 3: Reject review** (ask customer to resubmit without info)

    **Why this matters:**

    **Privacy protection:**
    - Prevents accidental personal info disclosure
    - GDPR/CCPA compliance
    - Protects customers from harassment/spam

    **Platform policy compliance:**
    - Many platforms prohibit personal info in reviews
    - Prevents policy violations

    **Spam prevention:**
    - Spammers often include contact info for business
    - Competitors trying to steal customers

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → General → Personal Information Restriction**

    **Options:**
    - **Auto-redact:** [email@example.com] → [removed]
    - **Auto-redact and notify:** Redact + email customer explaining removal
    - **Hold for manual review:** Flag review for moderator decision
    - **Reject and request edit:** Don't publish, ask customer to remove info

    <Check>
    **Recommended:** Use "Auto-redact and notify" for best balance of privacy and user experience.
    </Check>

    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Required Fields Configuration" icon="list-check">

    **Allow anonymous reviews:**
    - **Yes** for sensitive products (health, personal care)
    - **No** for most products (authenticity matters)
    - **Result:** 10-15% more submissions, but lower trust

    **Settings:**

## Quantity Restrictions

Prevent spam and duplicate reviews with submission limits.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Quantity Limit Per Product" defaultOpen icon="hashtag">
    **Set maximum reviews one customer can leave per product**

    **Limit options:**
    - **Unlimited** - Customer can review same product multiple times
    - **1 review per product** (recommended) - One review per product lifetime
    - **1 review per purchase** - Can review again if they buy again

    **Option 1: Unlimited reviews**
    **Allows:**

    - Buys again in June, reviews it again
    - Both reviews published

    **Use case:**
    - Products that improve with updates
    - Subscription products (review each delivery)
    - Products used differently over time

    **Option 2: 1 review per product (strict)**
    **Allows:**
    - Customer can submit only ONE review per product, ever
    - Even if they buy multiple times, only first review counts
    - Can edit existing review

    **Use case:**
    - Most ecommerce products (default recommendation)
    - Prevents review manipulation
    - Cleaner review section

    **Option 3: 1 review per purchase**
    **Allows:**
    - Customer can review product each time they buy it

    - Subscription boxes

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → General → Review Quantity Limit**

    <Info>
    **Data shows:** "1 review per product" prevents 95% of review manipulation attempts while maintaining authentic multi-purchase feedback via review edits.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reviews Per Order Limit" icon="receipt">
    **Control how many products can be reviewed from single order**

    **How it works:**
    - Customer places order with 5 products
    - You can limit to reviewing only 3 of those 5 products

    **Limit options:**
    - **Unlimited** (default) - Review all products in order
    - **1 product per order** - Choose their favorite to review
    - **3 products per order** - Review top 3
    - **5 products per order** - Review up to 5 maximum

    **Why limit reviews per order:**

    **Prevent review fatigue:**
    - Orders with 10+ items overwhelm customers
    - Limiting to 3-5 encourages quality over quantity
    - Reduces abandoned review forms

    **Focus on key products:**
    - Customers review products they care about most
    - Higher-quality, more detailed reviews
    - Better feedback signals

    **Reduce review spam:**
    - Bulk buyers can't flood system
    - Prevents 50+ review submissions from single customer
    - Maintains review diversity

    **When NOT to limit:**
    - Average order size is 1-2 products (no need)
    - B2C stores with small baskets
    - Trying to maximize review volume

    **When TO limit:**
    - B2B stores with bulk orders
    - Wholesale customers
    - Subscription boxes with 10+ items
    - After detecting review manipulation

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Eligibility → Max Reviews Per Order**

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Set limit to "5 products per order" - high enough for normal customers, low enough to prevent abuse. Covers 95% of retail orders.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Time Delay Between Reviews" icon="hourglass">
    **Prevent rapid-fire review submissions**

    **How it works:**
    - Customer submits review
    - Must wait X hours/days before submitting another review
    - Applies across all products (not per-product)

    **Delay options:**
    - **No delay** (default) - Submit unlimited reviews instantly
    - **1 hour** - Prevents bot spam, allows normal users
    - **24 hours** - Prevents review bombing
    - **7 days** - Strict limit, prevents bulk review incentive abuse

    **Use cases:**

    **No delay (default):**
    - Most stores (recommended)
    - Customers naturally don't review rapidly
    - Allows reviewing multiple order items

    **1-hour delay:**
    - Detected bot activity
    - Prevents automated spam
    - Doesn't impact real customers

    **24-hour delay:**
    - Review incentive programs (prevent gaming)
    - After detecting manipulation
    - Wholesale/B2B stores

    **7-day delay:**
    - Extreme spam situations only
    - May frustrate legitimate customers
    - Use as last resort

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Eligibility → Minimum Time Between Reviews**

    <Warning>
    **Use sparingly:** Time delays reduce review volume by 5-15% even for legitimate customers. Only enable if spam is a real problem.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting by IP Address" icon="location-dot">
    **Limit review submissions from same IP address**

    **How it works:**
    - Yuko tracks IP address of review submissions
    - Blocks excessive submissions from same IP
    - Helps prevent bot attacks and review farms

    **Rate limit options:**
    - **No limit** (default)
    - **5 reviews per day per IP** (recommended)
    - **10 reviews per day per IP** (generous)
    - **1 review per day per IP** (strict)

    **Why IP-based limiting matters:**

    **Prevents review farms:**
    - Paid review services use same IPs
    - Mass fake reviews blocked
    - 80-90% of organized fake reviews stopped

    **Stops bot attacks:**
    - Automated spam runs from single server
    - Rate limiting breaks automation
    - Forces manual submission (too slow for spammers)

    **Maintains legitimate reviews:**
    - Households with multiple shoppers
    - Offices/businesses
    - Public WiFi users

    **Limitations of IP blocking:**

    **False positives:**
    - Shared WiFi (coffee shops, hotels)
    - Corporate networks (multiple employees)
    - VPN users (appear same IP)

    **False negatives:**
    - Sophisticated attackers use IP rotation
    - Residential proxy networks
    - Mobile networks (different IPs per session)

    **Recommended approach:**
    - Set limit to 5-10 reviews per day per IP
    - High enough for legitimate use cases
    - Low enough to stop casual spam

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Eligibility → IP Rate Limiting**

    <Check>
    **Recommended:** 5 reviews per day per IP covers legitimate household/office use while preventing 90%+ of bot spam.

## Restriction Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to balance quality control with review volume.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Permissive, Then Restrict" defaultOpen icon="shield">
    **Begin open, tighten only when needed**

    **Phase 1: Launch (0-50 reviews)**
    - **Eligibility:** Anyone can review
    - **Content:** Minimal restrictions
    - **Quantity:** No limits
    - **Goal:** Build initial social proof

    **Phase 2: Growth (50-500 reviews)**
    - **Eligibility:** Keep open or switch to verified buyers
    - **Content:** Add personal info auto-removal
    - **Quantity:** 1 review per product
    - **Goal:** Maintain volume while improving quality

    **Phase 3: Established (500+ reviews)**
    - **Eligibility:** Verified buyers only (if spam is issue)
    - **Content:** Full restrictions (PII, limits, profanity)
    - **Quantity:** Strict limits
    - **Goal:** Maintain quality, volume less critical

    **Why this approach works:**
    - New stores need every review
    - Restrictions reduce volume by 20-60%
    - Easy to tighten later, hard to recover lost early reviews

    <Check>
    **Recommended:** Only add restrictions in response to actual problems, not preemptively.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Impact of Restrictions" icon="chart-line">

    - Compare 30 days before vs 30 days after each change
    - Adjust or remove restrictions that hurt more than help

    <Warning>
    **Red flag:** If restriction reduces volume by more than 30% but spam was less than 10%, consider removing it.

  <Accordion title="Combine Restrictions Thoughtfully" icon="layer-group">
    **Don't over-restrict - balance is key**

    **Low restriction (high volume):**
    - Anyone can review
    - No email verification
    - Optional review text
    - No time delays
    - **Result:** Maximum volume, moderate spam (5-15%)

    **Moderate restriction (recommended):**
    - Anyone can review
    - Personal info auto-removal
    - 1 review per product
    - 5 reviews/day per IP
    - **Result:** Good volume, low spam (2-5%)

    **High restriction (quality focus):**
    - Verified buyers only
    - Email verification
    - Minimum 50 characters
    - 1 review per product
    - **Result:** Lower volume (-40%), minimal spam (less than 1%)

    **Extreme restriction (rarely needed):**
    - Verified buyers only
    - Email + purchase verification
    - Minimum 100 characters
    - 7-day delay
    - Manual approval
    - **Result:** Very low volume (-60% to -80%), zero spam

    **Most stores should use moderate restrictions:**
    - Enough protection from spam
    - Maintains healthy review flow
    - Doesn't frustrate legitimate customers

    <Info>
    **Data shows:** Stores using moderate restrictions (3-4 rules) achieve optimal balance: 75-85% of unrestricted volume with 90-95% spam reduction.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communicate Restrictions to Customers" icon="comment">
    **Be transparent about review requirements**

    **On review submission form:**
    - "Reviews require a verified purchase from our store"
    - "Please allow 7 days after delivery before reviewing"
    - "Photos must be under 3 MB"
    - "One review per product ensures authentic feedback"

    **In review request emails:**
    - Mention eligibility clearly
    - Explain why restrictions exist (quality, authenticity)
    - Provide customer support contact for questions

    **On product pages:**
    - "All reviews are from verified buyers"
    - "We verify each purchase to ensure authentic feedback"
    - Trust signal, not barrier

    **When review is rejected:**
    - Clear explanation why (too short, duplicate, blacklisted email)
    - Instructions to fix and resubmit
    - Customer support contact

    **Communication reduces frustration:**
    - Customers understand requirements upfront
    - Fewer abandoned submissions
    - Higher completion rates

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Frame restrictions positively - "Verified purchase reviews help ensure authentic feedback" sounds better than "Only verified buyers can review."

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will restrictions reduce my review count?" icon="chart-line-down">
    **Yes, but quality often matters more than quantity**

    **Expected volume impact by restriction:**
    - **Verified buyers only:** -30% to -50%
    - **Email verification:** -15% to -30%
    - **Minimum characters:** -20% to -35%
    - **Time delays:** -10% to -20%
    - **Photo required:** -60% to -70%

    **When volume loss is worth it:**
    - Spam rate is higher than 10%
    - Competitor fake reviews detected
    - Review quality very low (one-word reviews)
    - Legal/compliance requirements

    **When volume loss is NOT worth it:**
    - Spam rate under 5%
    - You have fewer than 50 reviews per product
    - Restrictions drop you below social proof threshold

    **Mitigation strategies:**
    - Increase review request emails to offset losses
    - Offer incentives (discounts, loyalty points)
    - Make review process easier (mobile-optimized, autofill)

    <Check>
    **Rule of thumb:** If restrictions reduce volume by more than 30%, reassess whether you really need them.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can customers bypass these restrictions?" icon="user-secret">
    **Some restrictions can be bypassed, others cannot**

    **Hard to bypass (effective):**
    - **Verified buyer requirement:** Requires real purchase in your system
    - **IP rate limiting:** Requires expensive proxy infrastructure
    - **Email verification:** Requires access to real inbox
    - **1 review per product:** Tracked by customer account

    **Easier to bypass (less effective):**
    - **Email blacklist:** Create new email addresses
    - **Time delays:** Patient attackers can wait
    - **Character minimums:** Add gibberish text

    **How sophisticated attackers bypass:**
    - Buy cheap items to get verified buyer status
    - Use residential proxy networks (different IPs)
    - Use real email addresses (Gmail, Yahoo)
    - Meet all content requirements

    **No restriction is perfect:**
    - Focus on raising the barrier high enough
    - Most spam is low-effort (restrictions stop 90%)
    - Determined attackers (less than 5%) may still succeed
    - Manual moderation catches sophisticated attempts

    <Info>
    **Reality:** Restrictions stop 90-95% of spam/manipulation. The remaining 5-10% requires manual moderation and vigilance.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I allow anonymous reviews?" icon="mask">
    **Generally no, except for sensitive products**

    **Arguments for allowing anonymous:**
    - Increases submissions (10-20% more)
    - Good for sensitive products (health, personal care)
    - Protects privacy-conscious customers

    **Arguments against anonymous:**
    - Reduces trust significantly (40-50% less trusted)
    - Harder to verify authenticity
    - Looks like hiding fake reviews
    - Most platforms show names

    **Compromise approaches:**

    **Option 1: First name + last initial**
    - "John S." - more anonymous than full name
    - Still feels authentic
    - Most popular middle-ground

    **Option 2: Allow anonymous for specific products**
    - Set per product or category
    - Sensitive items only
    - Most products show names

    **Option 3: "Verified Buyer" as name**
    - No personal name shown
    - But verification badge proves real purchase
    - Maintains trust despite anonymity

    **Settings:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → Display → Reviewer Name Format**

    <Tip>
    **Recommended:** Use "First name + last initial" for best balance of privacy and authenticity. True anonymity should be reserved for genuinely sensitive products only.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle internal/employee reviews?" icon="building-user">
    **Block employee emails or label reviews clearly**

    **Option 1: Blacklist employee emails**
    - Add all @yourcompany.com to email blacklist
    - Employees cannot submit public reviews
    - Cleanest approach
    - Settings → **Manage Exclusions → Email Blacklist**

    **Option 2: Label employee reviews**
    - Allow submissions
    - Manually add "Company Employee" badge
    - Transparent approach
    - Good for beta testing, team dogfooding

    **Option 3: Separate internal feedback system**
    - Use internal tools for employee feedback
    - Keep public reviews customer-only
    - Most professional approach

    **What about friends/family:**
    - Generally allow (hard to detect/enforce)
    - Trust your moderation process
    - If egregiously fake, mark as spam

    **Legal considerations:**
    - FTC requires disclosure of material connections
    - Employees reviewing without disclosure = illegal
    - Safest to block entirely or require "Company Employee" label

    <Warning>
    **Legal risk:** Employee reviews without disclosure violate FTC guidelines and can result in penalties. Always disclose or block completely.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I restrict reviews on specific products?" icon="box-open">
    **Yes - use product blacklist feature**

    **Products commonly excluded:**
    - Gift cards (nothing to review)
    - Free samples (biased reviews)
    - Shipping fees (not actual products)
    - Discontinued items (no longer relevant)
    - Products under investigation (quality issues, recalls)

    **How to blacklist products:**
    1. Go to **Settings → Reviews → Manage Exclusions**
    2. Under **Product Blacklist**, click **Add Product**
    3. Enter Product ID, SKU, or name
    4. Save changes

    **What happens:**
    - Review request emails won't include blacklisted products
    - Review submission form won't show those products
    - Existing reviews remain (unless you delete them)
    - Product page shows "Reviews are not available for this product"

    **Temporary vs permanent blacklisting:**
    - **Temporary:** Quality issue resolved, reopen reviews
    - **Permanent:** Gift cards, services - never allow reviews

    <Note>
    **Detailed guide:** See **Product Blacklist** page for complete instructions and bulk import options.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do restrictions apply to imported reviews?" icon="file-import">
    **No - imported reviews bypass restrictions**

    **Why imported reviews are exempt:**
    - Already created (can't be restricted)
    - Came from verified system (WooCommerce, Judge.me)
    - Pre-date your Yuko restrictions
    - Historical data

    **What this means:**
    - Imported review might have 10 reviews from one customer (quantity limit bypassed)
    - Imported review might include personal info (not auto-removed)
    - Imported review might be from non-verified buyer

    **How to handle imported reviews:**

    **Option 1: Accept as-is**
    - Import and leave unchanged
    - Restrictions apply to new reviews only
    - Fastest approach

    **Option 2: Bulk clean imported reviews**
    - Run personal info removal on import
    - Deduplicate reviews (merge multiple from same customer)
    - Apply verification status where possible
    - More work, cleaner result

    **Option 3: Manual review post-import**
    - Import everything
    - Manually moderate questionable reviews
    - Remove obvious spam/duplicates
    - Balance of speed and quality

    **Settings:**
    During CSV import, check **"Apply content restrictions to imported reviews"** if you want auto-removal of personal info, profanity filtering, etc.

    <Info>
    **Recommended:** Import reviews as-is, then manually remove obvious spam or inappropriate content. Applying all restrictions to historical data often removes legitimate reviews.

<NeedHelp />

<Note>
**Pro tip:** Start with just 2-3 basic restrictions (personal info removal, 1 review per product, 5/day IP limit). Add more only if you encounter specific problems. Over-restricting costs more in lost reviews than it saves in prevented spam.
</Note>

**Next:** Learn how to use the **Email Blacklist** to block specific addresses and domains from submitting reviews.
