## Automate Review Approval for Faster Social Proof

Manually approving every review takes time. Auto-publishing lets you automatically approve reviews that meet your criteria, so positive social proof appears instantly while questionable reviews still get your attention.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Publish new reviews instantly (no manual work)
- Keep spam and offensive content unpublished
- Reduce daily moderation time
- Show fresh social proof to increase conversions
- Maintain review quality while speeding up workflow

<Info>
  **Impact:** Stores using smart auto-publish rules get 40-50% more reviews displayed while maintaining quality standards

## How Auto-Publishing Works

Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → General → Auto-Publishing**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Submits Review" icon="paper-plane">
    Customer leaves a review via email request or on-site form.

    **Review data includes:**

    - Star rating (1-5)
    - Review text
    - Photos/videos (optional)
    - Reviewer name and email
    - Verified purchase status
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yuko Checks Auto-Publish Rules" icon="list-check">
    System evaluates the review against your configured rules.

    **Common rule checks:**

    - Star rating (4-5 stars?)
    - Verified purchase? (Yes/No)
    - Contains spam keywords?
    - Email domain blacklisted?
    - Product blacklisted?
    - Review length sufficient?

    **If ALL criteria met:** Auto-approve ✅ **If ANY criteria fails:** Send to pending ⏸️
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Published or Held" icon="clock">
    Based on rules, review is either published immediately or held for moderation.

    **Auto-published reviews:**

    - Appear on product page instantly
    - Count toward average rating
    - Visible in review widgets
    - Indexed by search engines

    **Pending reviews:**

    - Held in moderation queue
    - You review manually
    - Approve or reject
    - Slower but more control
  </Step>
  <Step title="You Review Exceptions" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Check pending reviews periodically.

    **What ends up pending:**

    - 1-3 star reviews (if rule set)
    - Unverified purchases
    - Suspicious content
    - First-time reviewers

    **Your decision:**

    - Approve if legitimate
    - Reject if spam
    - Reply before publishing
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Auto-Publishing Configuration

Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → General → Auto-Publishing Rules**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Auto Publish New Reviews" defaultOpen={false} icon="star">
    **Auto-publish based on review rating**

    - Automatically publish all new incoming reviews.
    - What happens when enabled:
    - Reviews go live instantly
    - No manual approval needed
    - Great for fast social proof
    - What happens when disabled:
    - All reviews remain Unpublished
    - You must approve reviews manually
    - Better control, slower publishing

    ```
    Auto-publish reviews with rating:
    [ ] 5 stars only
    [✓] 4-5 stars (recommended)
    [ ] All ratings
    [ ] None (manual moderation)
    ```

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Auto-publish 4-5 stars. This captures 70-80% of reviews and lets them go live instantly, while you still catch negative feedback early.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Profanity Filter" icon="badge-check">
    Control how Yuko handles reviews containing offensive words.

    Options:

    **Disabled** – No filtering

    **Replace banned words with asterisks (**\* )\*\* – Review is published, profanity masked

    **Hide review containing banned words**\
    Review is prevented from publishing and marked as Unpublished in your Reviews Dashboard

    - Many legitimate reviews from guest checkouts
    - These show as "unverified" (no email match)
    - Manually approve if review is quality content
    - Consider auto-publishing unverified 5-star reviews

    <Check>
      **Best practice:** Enable profanity filtering with “hide review” to keep your review section clean and professional without exposing offensive language to customers.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Spam Filter" icon="text-size">
    - Automatically catch suspicious or low-quality reviews.
    - When enabled:
    - Spam reviews are filtered out
    - Flagged as Spam in the dashboard
    - Not published on your store
    - When to enable:
    - You receive frequent fake/spam reviews
    - You want cleaner moderation without manual checks
  </Accordion>

    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change auto-publish settings after launch?" icon="sliders">
    **Yes - adjust anytime based on results**

    **Common adjustments:**

    **Tighten rules if:**

    - Spam increasing
    - Low-quality reviews appearing
    - Negative reviews need more attention
    - Growing too fast to monitor

    **Example:** Switch from auto-publish all to auto-publish 4-5 stars only

    **Loosen rules if:**

    - Too much manual work
    - Missing social proof opportunity
    - Spam filters working well
    - Review volume overwhelming moderation

    **Example:** Switch from manual to auto-publish verified purchases

    **How to change:**

    1. Go to Settings → Reviews → Auto-Publishing
    2. Update rules
    3. Save changes
    4. Applies to new reviews immediately
    5. Existing reviews unaffected

    **Testing changes:**

    - Monitor for 7 days
    - Check spam rate and moderation time
    - Adjust again if needed

    **Seasonal adjustments:**

    - Holiday season: More conservative (higher volume)
    - Slow periods: More aggressive (need reviews)
    - Product launches: Manual review initially
    - After issues resolved: Back to auto-publish

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Review your auto-publish settings quarterly. As your store grows and review patterns change, optimize your rules for current volume and quality.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to reviews already in pending?" icon="clock">
    **Auto-publish rules only affect new reviews**

    **Pending reviews:**

    - Remain in pending queue
    - Not automatically published
    - Still require manual approval
    - Rules don't apply retroactively

    **Why:**

    - Already flagged for review
    - May have issues requiring attention
    - You should review manually
    - Prevents bulk auto-approval of old spam

    **If you want to bulk approve pending:**

    1. Go to Reviews → Pending
    2. Review list
    3. Select all quality reviews
    4. Bulk approve
    5. Takes effect immediately

    **After changing settings:**

    - New reviews follow new rules
    - Old pending reviews still manual
    - Clear out pending queue manually
    - Then only new reviews in pending

    **Best practice:** Clean up pending queue before changing auto-publish settings, so you start fresh.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I auto-publish some products but not others?" icon="box">
    **Yes - use product blacklist for exceptions**

    **Scenario:** Auto-publish for most products, but manually review for:

    - New product launches
    - Products with quality issues
    - Controversial products
    - High-return items

    **How to set up:**

    1. Go to Settings → Reviews → Product Blacklist
    2. Add specific products to blacklist
    3. Reviews for those products go to pending
    4. All other products follow auto-publish rules

    **Example use case:**

    - Store auto-publishes 4-5 star verified reviews
    - BUT: New product launched last week
    - Add to product blacklist temporarily
    - All reviews for new product → Pending
    - Monitor feedback for first 30 days
    - Remove from blacklist once confident

    **Another example:**

    - Product has sizing issues
    - Blacklist that product
    - Manually review all reviews
    - Reply addressing sizing before publishing
    - Prevents negative reviews without context

    → [Learn about product blacklist](/managing-reviews/product-blacklist)

    <Note>
      **Temporary vs permanent:** Use blacklist temporarily for new products or issues. Remove once stable. Don't permanently blacklist products (defeats auto-publish purpose).
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I auto-publish reviews with photos?" icon="camera">
    **Yes - photo reviews are valuable and usually legitimate**

    **Why auto-publish photo reviews:**

    - **Higher trust:** Customers who upload photos usually genuine
    - **More effort:** Spammers rarely add photos
    - **Valuable content:** Photo reviews convert 3x better
    - **Customer engagement:** Reward customers who go extra mile

    **Recommended rule:**

    - Auto-publish ANY review with photos (even 3-star if has photos)
    - Photos indicate authentic customer
    - Rarely spam

    **Settings:**

    ```
    Auto-publish if:
    [✓] Has photos (any rating)
    OR
    [✓] 4-5 stars without photos
    ```

    **Exception handling:**

    - Inappropriate photos → Auto-detect and hold
    - Competitor product photos → Manual review
    - Offensive images → Spam filter catches

    **Photo review fast-track:**

    - Some platforms auto-approve photo reviews regardless of rating
    - Rewards customer effort
    - Increases photo review rate
    - Generally safe (legitimate customers upload photos)

    **Trade-off:**

    - 3-star review with photos goes live
    - But: Photo provides context
    - Customers see authentic feedback
    - You can still reply

    <Check>
      **Recommended:** Auto-publish all reviews with photos, regardless of rating. Photo reviews are 95% legitimate and highly valuable for conversion.

<NeedHelp />

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Start with conservative auto-publish rules (4-5 stars + verified only). After 30 days, loosen restrictions if spam is low. It's easier to start strict and loosen than to deal with spam from being too permissive.
