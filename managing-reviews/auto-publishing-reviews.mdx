## Automate Review Approval for Faster Social Proof

Manually approving every review takes time. Auto-publishing lets you automatically approve reviews that meet your criteria, so positive social proof appears instantly while questionable reviews still get your attention.

**What you'll achieve:**

- Publish new reviews instantly (no manual work)
- Keep spam and offensive content unpublished
- Reduce daily moderation time
- Show fresh social proof to increase conversions
- Maintain review quality while speeding up workflow

<Info>
  **Impact:** Stores using smart auto-publish rules get 40-50% more reviews displayed while maintaining quality standards

## How Auto-Publishing Works

Yuko automatically checks each incoming review and decides whether to publish it instantly or hold it for manual moderation — based on the rules you set.

### When a customer submits a review:

- Review is received with rating, text, media, and reviewer details
- Yuko evaluates it using your auto-publish settings

### Auto-Publish New Reviews:

**If enabled:**

- New reviews are auto-approved
- Review becomes visible on product pages immediately
- Added to all review widgets
- Included in average rating\
  If disabled:
- All reviews go to Pending
- You manually approve each one

### Star Rating Rules:

You choose which ratings auto-publish:

- Example: Only 5-star reviews go live automatically
- Other ratings (1–4 stars) move to Pending
- Gives you tighter control over low-rated reviews

### If review meets your rules → **Published**

- Visible instantly
- No moderation needed
- Adds to social proof
- Helps increase conversion rates

### If review does NOT meet your rules → **Pending**

- Hidden from customers
- Requires manual approval
- You can approve, reject, or reply before publishing
- Recommended to check pending reviews daily

### What typically ends up Pending:

- Ratings outside your auto-publish selection
- Low-star reviews (1–3 stars)
- First-time reviewers
- Reviews with suspicious patterns
- Reviews you want to inspect manually

### What you achieve with auto-publishing:

- Faster display of positive reviews
- Reduced daily moderation workload
- Stronger and more frequent social proof
- Control over negative or uncertain reviews

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I auto-publish reviews with photos?" icon="camera">
    **Yes - photo reviews are valuable and usually legitimate**

    **Why auto-publish photo reviews:**

    - **Higher trust:** Customers who upload photos usually genuine
    - **More effort:** Spammers rarely add photos
    - **Valuable content:** Photo reviews convert 3x better
    - **Customer engagement:** Reward customers who go extra mile

    **Recommended rule:**

    - Auto-publish ANY review with photos (even 3-star if has photos)
    - Photos indicate authentic customer
    - Rarely spam

    **Settings:**

    ```
    Auto-publish if:
    [✓] Has photos (any rating)
    OR
    [✓] 4-5 stars without photos
    ```

    **Exception handling:**

    - Inappropriate photos → Auto-detect and hold
    - Competitor product photos → Manual review
    - Offensive images → Spam filter catches

    **Photo review fast-track:**

    - Some platforms auto-approve photo reviews regardless of rating
    - Rewards customer effort
    - Increases photo review rate
    - Generally safe (legitimate customers upload photos)

    **Trade-off:**

    - 3-star review with photos goes live
    - But: Photo provides context
    - Customers see authentic feedback
    - You can still reply

    <Check>
      **Recommended:** Auto-publish all reviews with photos, regardless of rating. Photo reviews are 95% legitimate and highly valuable for conversion.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Start with conservative auto-publish rules (4-5 stars + verified only). After 30 days, loosen restrictions if spam is low. It's easier to start strict and loosen than to deal with spam from being too permissive.
