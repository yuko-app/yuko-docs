## Automate Review Approval for Faster Social Proof

Manually approving every review takes time. Auto-publishing lets you automatically approve reviews that meet your criteria, so positive social proof appears instantly while questionable reviews still get your attention.

**What you'll achieve:**
- Publish quality reviews immediately without manual work
- Filter low-quality reviews for manual review
- Balance speed with quality control
- Save 30-60 minutes per day on moderation
- Build social proof faster

<Info>
**Impact:** Stores using smart auto-publish rules get 40-50% more reviews displayed while maintaining quality standards

## How Auto-Publishing Works

Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → General → Auto-Publishing**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Submits Review" icon="paper-plane">
    Customer leaves a review via email request or on-site form.

    **Review data includes:**
    - Star rating (1-5)
    - Review text
    - Photos/videos (optional)
    - Reviewer name and email
    - Verified purchase status
  </Step>

  <Step title="Yuko Checks Auto-Publish Rules" icon="list-check">
    System evaluates the review against your configured rules.

    **Common rule checks:**
    - Star rating (4-5 stars?)
    - Verified purchase? (Yes/No)
    - Contains spam keywords?
    - Email domain blacklisted?
    - Product blacklisted?
    - Review length sufficient?

    **If ALL criteria met:** Auto-approve ✅
    **If ANY criteria fails:** Send to pending ⏸️
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Published or Held" icon="clock">
    Based on rules, review is either published immediately or held for moderation.

    **Auto-published reviews:**
    - Appear on product page instantly
    - Count toward average rating
    - Visible in review widgets
    - Indexed by search engines

    **Pending reviews:**
    - Held in moderation queue
    - You review manually
    - Approve or reject
    - Slower but more control
  </Step>

  <Step title="You Review Exceptions" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Check pending reviews periodically.

    **What ends up pending:**
    - 1-3 star reviews (if rule set)
    - Unverified purchases
    - Suspicious content
    - First-time reviewers

    **Your decision:**
    - Approve if legitimate
    - Reject if spam
    - Reply before publishing
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Auto-Publishing Strategies

Choose the approach that fits your store's needs:

<Tabs>

    **Rules:**
    - ✅ Auto-publish: 4-5 star reviews + verified purchase

## Auto-Publishing Configuration

Yuko Dashboard → **Settings → Reviews → General → Auto-Publishing Rules**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="By Star Rating" defaultOpen icon="star">
    **Auto-publish based on review rating**

    **Common configurations:**

    **Option 1: Auto-publish 4-5 stars only**
    - ✅ 5-star reviews: Auto-publish
    - ✅ 4-star reviews: Auto-publish
    - ⏸️ 1-3 star reviews: Pending review

    **Best for:** Most stores (balanced approach)

    **Option 2: Auto-publish 5 stars only**
    - ✅ 5-star reviews: Auto-publish
    - ⏸️ 1-4 star reviews: Pending review

    **Best for:** Conservative moderation, luxury brands

    **Option 3: Auto-publish all ratings**
    - ✅ All ratings: Auto-publish

    **Best for:** High-trust stores, full automation

    **Settings:**
    ```
    Auto-publish reviews with rating:
    [ ] 5 stars only
    [✓] 4-5 stars (recommended)
    [ ] All ratings
    [ ] None (manual moderation)
    ```

    **Why filter by rating:**
    - Positive reviews (4-5 stars) are safe to publish
    - Negative reviews (1-3 stars) need your attention
    - Respond to concerns before they're public
    - Balance speed with reputation management

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Auto-publish 4-5 stars. This captures 70-80% of reviews and lets them go live instantly, while you still catch negative feedback early.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="By Verified Purchase Status" icon="badge-check">
    **Auto-publish only verified purchases**

    **Settings:**
    ```
    Auto-publish only if:
    [✓] Verified purchase (recommended)
    [ ] Any customer (verified or not)
    ```

    **Verified purchase criteria:**
    - Reviewer email matches order email
    - Order confirmed and delivered
    - Product purchased in last 12 months

    **Why verified-only:**
    - **Reduces fake reviews:** 95% of fake reviews are unverified
    - **Higher trust:** Verified badge shows authenticity
    - **Lower spam:** Spammers don't have order history
    - **Quality signal:** Real customers write better reviews

    **Trade-offs:**

    **If enabled (verified only):**
    - ✅ Higher quality reviews
    - ✅ Less spam
    - ❌ Some legitimate reviews held (guest checkouts)
    - ❌ Lower review count initially

    **If disabled (any customer):**
    - ✅ More reviews published
    - ✅ Capture guest checkout reviews
    - ❌ Higher spam risk
    - ❌ More manual moderation needed

    **Recommended approach:**
    - Enable verified-only for auto-publish
    - Manually review unverified reviews
    - Approve legitimate unverified reviews case-by-case

    **Guest checkout handling:**
    - Many legitimate reviews from guest checkouts
    - These show as "unverified" (no email match)
    - Manually approve if review is quality content
    - Consider auto-publishing unverified 5-star reviews

    <Check>
    **Best practice:** Auto-publish only verified purchases. This prevents 90% of spam while still getting most quality reviews live quickly.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="By Review Length" icon="text-size">
    **Require minimum review length**

    **Settings:**
    ```
    Auto-publish only if review text:
    [ ] Any length (including star-only)
    [✓] At least 10 characters
    [ ] At least 50 characters
    [ ] At least 100 characters
    ```

    **Why set minimum length:**
    - Filters out "Great!" reviews (not helpful)
    - Encourages detailed feedback
    - Higher quality reviews
    - Better social proof value

    **Length recommendations:**

    **No minimum (any length):**
    - Allows star-only reviews (no text)
    - Fastest auto-publishing
    - More reviews displayed
    - But: Less helpful content

    **10+ characters:**
    - Filters out "ok", "good", "bad" reviews
    - Still allows brief reviews
    - Balanced approach
    - **Recommended**

    **50+ characters:**
    - Ensures meaningful content
    - Detailed reviews only
    - Higher quality
    - But: Many reviews held for manual review

    **100+ characters:**
    - Very detailed reviews only
    - Highest quality
    - But: Most reviews require manual approval
    - Too strict for auto-publish

    **Star-only reviews:**
    - Should you auto-publish reviews with no text?
    - **Yes if:** You want max review volume
    - **No if:** You want quality content only

    **Recommended:** Minimum 10 characters for auto-publish. This filters out low-effort reviews while allowing brief but helpful feedback.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="By Spam Keywords" icon="shield-halved">
    **Block reviews containing spam patterns**

    **Auto-hold reviews containing:**
    - Competitor brand names
    - URLs or links
    - Email addresses
    - Phone numbers
    - Profanity
    - Blacklisted words

    **Settings:**
    ```
    Hold for review if contains:
    [✓] Competitor names
    [✓] URLs/links
    [✓] Contact information
    [✓] Profanity
    [ ] Custom keyword list
    ```

    **Competitor name detection:**
    - Add competitor brand names to list
    - Reviews mentioning competitors held for review
    - You decide: Approve if favorable comparison, reject if spam

    **Example:** "Better than [Competitor]!" → Held for review → You approve (favorable comparison)

    **URL/link detection:**
    - Reviews with URLs often spam
    - Prevents links to competitor sites
    - Auto-hold for manual review

    **Example:** "Buy from this-other-site.com" → Held as spam

    **Contact info detection:**
    - Phone numbers, emails in reviews
    - Usually spam or inappropriate
    - Auto-hold for removal

    **Profanity filter:**
    - Common swear words flagged
    - Review held for you to edit or reject
    - Or auto-censor (replace with [removed])

    **Custom keyword list:**
    - Add your own blocked words
    - Industry-specific spam terms
    - Product names to flag

    **Example custom keywords:**
    - "free shipping" (spam phrase)
    - "discount code" (spam phrase)
    - "[specific product issue]" (manual review before public)

    <Warning>
    **Don't over-filter:** Too many blocked keywords means too many reviews in pending. Start with basics (URLs, profanity) and add more only if needed.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="By First-Time Reviewer" icon="user-plus">
    **Handle first-time reviewers differently**

    **Settings:**
    ```
    First-time reviewers:
    [ ] Auto-publish (trust by default)
    [✓] Hold for review (verify first)
    [ ] Require verification email
    ```

    **First-time reviewer = customer's first review on your store**

    **Why hold first reviews:**
    - **Spam check:** Spammers often leave first review then disappear
    - **Quality gate:** Establish standards with first review
    - **Welcome opportunity:** Reply and thank them
    - **Fake review risk:** Competitors often leave one-off negative reviews

    **Why auto-publish first reviews:**
    - **Speed:** Get reviews live faster
    - **Trust:** Most first reviews are legitimate
    - **Volume:** Don't bottleneck on manual review
    - **Growth:** Encourage more reviews with fast publishing

    **Recommended approach:**

    **Conservative:** Hold first reviews for manual check
    - Approve after quick verification
    - Reply to welcome them
    - Sets quality expectation

    **Balanced:** Auto-publish first reviews if 4-5 stars + verified purchase
    - Trusts verified customers
    - Still catches unverified first reviews

    **Aggressive:** Auto-publish all first reviews
    - Maximum speed
    - Trust spam filters to catch issues
    - Remove bad reviews reactively

    **Verification email option:**
    - Send email to confirm reviewer's email address
    - Click to verify before review published
    - Prevents fake email spam
    - Adds friction (lowers completion rate by 20-30%)

    <Tip>
    **Recommended:** Hold first-time unverified reviews, auto-publish first-time verified purchases. This balances speed with spam protection.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="By Time of Submission" icon="clock">
    **Auto-publish during business hours only**

    **Settings:**
    ```
    Auto-publish timing:
    [✓] Immediately (24/7)
    [ ] Business hours only (9 AM - 5 PM)
    [ ] Delay until reviewed (max 24 hours)
    ```

    **Immediate (24/7):**
    - Reviews go live any time of day
    - Fastest social proof
    - But: Negative reviews appear when you're sleeping

    **Business hours only:**
    - Auto-publish 9 AM - 5 PM (your timezone)
    - After hours reviews held until morning
    - You can catch issues before they're public
    - Good for stores with reputation concerns

    **Delay until reviewed:**
    - Auto-publish after X hours if not manually reviewed
    - Gives you time to check
    - Auto-approves if you don't reject
    - Backup in case you miss moderation

    **When to restrict timing:**
    - New stores (want to see reviews before public)
    - Products with quality issues (check feedback first)
    - High-visibility periods (launch, sales)
    - One-person team (only available during work hours)

    **When to go 24/7:**
    - Established stores (trust your system)
    - Strong spam filters
    - Automated monitoring
    - Team coverage

    **Recommended:** 24/7 auto-publish if you have good rules in place. Delaying reviews slows social proof building with minimal benefit.

    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change auto-publish settings after launch?" icon="sliders">
    **Yes - adjust anytime based on results**

    **Common adjustments:**

    **Tighten rules if:**
    - Spam increasing
    - Low-quality reviews appearing
    - Negative reviews need more attention

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Review your auto-publish settings quarterly. As your store grows and review patterns change, optimize your rules for current volume and quality.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to reviews already in pending?" icon="clock">
    **Auto-publish rules only affect new reviews**

    **Pending reviews:**
    - Remain in pending queue
    - Not automatically published
    - Still require manual approval
    - Rules don't apply retroactively

    **Why:**
    - Already flagged for review
    - May have issues requiring attention
    - You should review manually
    - Prevents bulk auto-approval of old spam

    **If you want to bulk approve pending:**
    1. Go to Reviews → Pending
    2. Review list
    3. Select all quality reviews
    4. Bulk approve
    5. Takes effect immediately

    **After changing settings:**
    - New reviews follow new rules
    - Old pending reviews still manual
    - Clear out pending queue manually
    - Then only new reviews in pending

    **Best practice:** Clean up pending queue before changing auto-publish settings, so you start fresh.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I auto-publish some products but not others?" icon="box">
    **Yes - use product blacklist for exceptions**

    **Scenario:** Auto-publish for most products, but manually review for:
    - New product launches
    - Products with quality issues
    - Controversial products
    - High-return items

    **How to set up:**
    1. Go to Settings → Reviews → Product Blacklist
    2. Add specific products to blacklist
    3. Reviews for those products go to pending
    4. All other products follow auto-publish rules

    **Example use case:**
    - Store auto-publishes 4-5 star verified reviews
    - BUT: New product launched last week
    - Add to product blacklist temporarily
    - All reviews for new product → Pending
    - Monitor feedback for first 30 days
    - Remove from blacklist once confident

    **Another example:**
    - Product has sizing issues
    - Blacklist that product
    - Manually review all reviews
    - Reply addressing sizing before publishing
    - Prevents negative reviews without context

    → [Learn about product blacklist](/managing-reviews/product-blacklist)

    <Note>
    **Temporary vs permanent:** Use blacklist temporarily for new products or issues. Remove once stable. Don't permanently blacklist products (defeats auto-publish purpose).
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I auto-publish reviews with photos?" icon="camera">
    **Yes - photo reviews are valuable and usually legitimate**

    **Why auto-publish photo reviews:**
    - **Higher trust:** Customers who upload photos usually genuine
    - **More effort:** Spammers rarely add photos
    - **Valuable content:** Photo reviews convert 3x better
    - **Customer engagement:** Reward customers who go extra mile

    **Recommended rule:**
    - Auto-publish ANY review with photos (even 3-star if has photos)
    - Photos indicate authentic customer
    - Rarely spam

    **Settings:**
    ```
    Auto-publish if:
    [✓] Has photos (any rating)
    OR
    [✓] 4-5 stars without photos
    ```

    **Exception handling:**
    - Inappropriate photos → Auto-detect and hold
    - Competitor product photos → Manual review
    - Offensive images → Spam filter catches

    **Photo review fast-track:**
    - Some platforms auto-approve photo reviews regardless of rating
    - Rewards customer effort
    - Increases photo review rate
    - Generally safe (legitimate customers upload photos)

    **Trade-off:**
    - 3-star review with photos goes live
    - But: Photo provides context
    - Customers see authentic feedback
    - You can still reply
