- 95%+ block rate for repeat spammer attempts
</Info>

## Understanding Email Blacklisting

Email blacklisting prevents specific addresses or entire domains from submitting reviews.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Individual Email Blocking" icon="envelope">
    **Block specific email addresses**

    - Single addresses (john.doe@spam.com)
    - Exact match required
    - Blocks that specific user only
    - Good for repeat offenders

    **Example:**
    - competitor@rivalstore.com
    - spammer123@gmail.com
    - abusiveuser@email.com

    **Use for:** Targeting specific problem users
  </Card>

  <Card title="Domain Blocking" icon="globe">
    **Block entire email domains**

    - All addresses from domain (@spam.com)
    - Wildcard matching
    - Blocks all users from that domain
    - Good for competitor stores, disposable email services

    **Example:**
    - @competitorstore.com
    - @tempmail.com
    - @yourcompany.com (internal)

    **Use for:** Broad protection against spam sources
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Email Blacklist Uses

Understand the primary scenarios for blocking emails.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Competitor Protection">
    **Block competitor employees and stores**

    **Why block competitors:**
    - Prevent fake negative reviews from rivals
    - Stop industrial espionage via review forms
    - Protect against coordinated review attacks
    - Maintain fair competitive environment

    **What to block:**
    - Competitor company domains (@competitorstore.com)
    - Known competitor employee emails
    - Competitor franchisee domains
    - Related business emails

    **How to identify competitor emails:**
    1. Check email domains in suspicious negative reviews
    2. Look for patterns (multiple reviews from same domain)
    3. Cross-reference with known competitor websites
    4. Monitor industry competitor lists

    **Example blacklist entries:**
    ```
    @rivalstore.com
    @competitor-shop.com
    @bigcompetitor.net
    marketing@competitor.com
    ```

    <Warning>
    **Legal note:** Blocking competitors is legal and common practice. However, document your reasons (spam/abuse) in case of disputes.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Internal Account Protection">
    **Block company and test accounts**

    **Why block internal accounts:**
    - Keeps test reviews out of public view
    - Prevents employee bias (positive or negative)
    - Maintains review authenticity
    - FTC compliance (employee reviews require disclosure)

    **What to block:**
    - Company email domain (@yourcompany.com)
    - Test account emails (test@, demo@, admin@)
    - Developer accounts (dev@, staging@)
    - Contractor/agency emails

    **Common patterns to block:**
    ```
    @yourcompany.com (entire company domain)
    test@yourstore.com
    admin@yourstore.com
    dev@yourstore.com
    demo@yourstore.com
    staging@yourstore.com
    ```

    **Alternative approach:**
    - Allow employee reviews but label them "Company Employee"
    - Good for beta testing and internal dogfooding
    - Requires manual moderation and labeling

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Create a separate testing subdomain (e.g., @test.yourstore.com) and blacklist only that, allowing employee personal emails if needed for legitimate testing.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Disposable Email Blocking">
    **Block temporary email services**

    **Why block disposable emails:**
    - Throwaway accounts used for spam
    - Fake review farms
    - No accountability (emails expire)
    - Cannot follow up or verify

    **Common disposable email services:**
    ```
    @tempmail.com
    @10minutemail.com
    @guerrillamail.com
    @mailinator.com
    @throwaway.email
    @temp-mail.org
    @fakeinbox.com
    @trashmail.com
    @maildrop.cc
    @getnada.com
    ```

    **How to find disposable email domains:**
    - Use public blacklists (GitHub: disposable-email-domains)
    - Monitor review submissions for patterns
    - Check domain age (newly registered = suspicious)
    - Look for email format patterns (@randomstring.domain)

    **Bulk import disposable domains:**
    1. Download list from GitHub or other source
    2. Format as CSV (one domain per line)
    3. Import via Yuko bulk upload
    4. 10,000+ domains blocked instantly

    <Check>
    **Recommended:** Import comprehensive disposable email list (available in Yuko settings). Blocks 99% of throwaway email spam.
    </Check>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Repeat Offender Blocking">
    **Block spammers and abusive users**

    **Reasons to block individual users:**
    - Multiple spam review attempts
    - Abusive or harassing content
    - Review manipulation (fake positives/negatives)
    - Violating community guidelines repeatedly

    **How to identify repeat offenders:**
    1. Check review history by email
    2. Look for patterns (same IP, similar content)
    3. Monitor flagged/rejected reviews
    4. Track users with high spam scores

    **Blocking workflow:**
    1. User submits problematic review
    2. Review marked as spam/rejected
    3. Add email to blacklist
    4. Future attempts auto-blocked
    5. User receives "not eligible to review" message

    **Documentation:**
    - Keep notes on why each user was blocked
    - Helpful for disputes or audits
    - Track escalation (warning → temporary → permanent)

    **Unblocking:**
    - Allow appeals via customer support
    - Review after 30-90 days for temporary blocks
    - Permanent blocks for severe violations only

    <Info>
    **Data shows:** Blocking repeat offenders after 2-3 violations reduces moderation time by 60% while maintaining legitimate review flow.

## Advanced Blacklist Strategies

Sophisticated techniques for maximum protection with minimal false positives.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pattern Matching and Wildcards" defaultOpen icon="asterisk">
    **Use wildcards for flexible blocking**

    **Basic wildcards:**
    - `@domain.com` - Blocks all emails from domain.com
    - `test@domain.com` - Blocks specific email only

    **Advanced wildcards:**

    **Subdomain blocking:**
    ```
    @*.tempmail.com - Blocks sub1.tempmail.com, sub2.tempmail.com, etc.
    ```

    **Prefix patterns:**
    ```
    test*@yourstore.com - Blocks test@, test1@, test2@, testing@
    admin*@yourstore.com - Blocks admin@, administrator@, admin1@
    demo*@yourstore.com - Blocks demo@, demo1@, demo-account@
    ```

    **TLD wildcards:**
    ```
    @competitor.* - Blocks competitor.com, competitor.net, competitor.co.uk
    ```

    **Pattern matching (regex):**
    ```
    @.*mail.*\.com - Blocks tempmail.com, fakemail.com, trashmail.com
    ^[0-9]+@.* - Blocks emails starting with numbers (spam pattern)
    ```

    **Common test patterns to block:**
    ```
    test*@*
    demo*@*
    admin*@*
    staging*@*
    dev*@*
    ```

    <Warning>
    **Be careful with wildcards:** Overly broad patterns (e.g., `*@*.com`) can block legitimate customers. Test thoroughly before deploying.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conditional Blocking" icon="filter">
    **Block emails only under certain conditions**

    **Available conditions:**

    **Block if unverified purchase:**
    - Allow verified buyers even if on blacklist
    - Block disposable emails ONLY for non-purchasers
    - Good for reducing false positives

    **Block if low order value:**
    - Allow blacklisted email if order value greater than $50
    - Prevents blocking legitimate B2B buyers
    - Good for wholesale/corporate domains

    **Block if new account:**
    - Block disposable emails only for accounts created less than 7 days ago
    - Established accounts allowed
    - Reduces spam while allowing legitimate users

    **Block if multiple attempts:**
    - First review attempt: Allow
    - Second attempt from same email: Block
    - Gives benefit of doubt, catches repeat spammers

    **Configuration:**
    Settings → **Email Blacklist → Advanced → Conditional Blocking**

    **Example rule:**
    ```
    IF email matches @tempmail.com
    AND verified_purchase = false
    AND account_age less than 7 days
    THEN block
    ELSE allow with manual review
    ```

    <Tip>
    **Recommended:** Use conditional blocking for disposable emails. Block only unverified purchases to reduce false positives while maintaining spam protection.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temporary vs Permanent Blocks" icon="clock">
    **Set expiration dates for blacklist entries**

    **Temporary blocks (time-based):**

    **7-day temporary block:**
    - Good for suspicious first-time offenders
    - Cooling-off period
    - Auto-unblocks after 7 days

    **30-day temporary block:**
    - Repeat offenders (2-3 violations)
    - Review manipulation attempts
    - Auto-unblocks after 30 days if no appeal

    **90-day temporary block:**
    - Serious violations (hate speech, harassment)
    - Near-permanent but allows redemption
    - Manual review before unblock

    **Permanent blocks (no expiration):**
    - Severe violations (threats, illegal content)
    - Confirmed competitor attacks
    - Organized spam campaigns
    - No automatic unblock

    **How to set expiration:**
    1. Add email to blacklist
    2. Set **Expiration Date** field
    3. Optional: Set **Auto-Notify** to email user when unblocked
    4. Save entry

    **Escalation policy:**
    - 1st offense: Warning (no block)
    - 2nd offense: 7-day block
    - 3rd offense: 30-day block
    - 4th offense: Permanent block

    <Info>
    **Best practice:** Use temporary blocks for 80% of cases. Reserve permanent blocks for truly severe violations. Gives users chance to reform while protecting system.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Appeal Process for Blocked Users" icon="gavel">
    **Allow legitimate users to request unblocking**

    **Why appeals matter:**
    - False positives happen (5-10% of blocks)
    - Legitimate users blocked by overly broad rules
    - Customer satisfaction and retention
    - Legal compliance (right to explanation)

    **Setup appeal process:**

    **Step 1: Create appeal form**
    - Simple form: name, email, reason for appeal
    - Hosted on yourstore.com/review-appeal
    - Link shown to blocked users

    **Step 2: Configure blocked user message**
    Settings → **Email Blacklist → Blocked User Message**
    ```
    Your email is not eligible to submit reviews. If you believe
    this is an error, please contact support@yourstore.com or
    submit an appeal at yourstore.com/review-appeal.
    ```

    **Step 3: Review appeals weekly**
    1. Check appeal submissions
    2. Verify legitimacy (check order history, review history)
    3. Unblock if legitimate
    4. Reply to user with outcome

    **Common legitimate appeals:**
    - Corporate email blocked by domain blacklist (legitimate B2B buyer)
    - Shared email address (family/office)
    - Previously blocked for mistake, wants to resubmit properly
    - Email similar to spammer but different person

    **Appeal decision criteria:**
    - ✅ Has valid order history
    - ✅ No previous spam submissions
    - ✅ Reasonable explanation
    - ❌ Multiple spam attempts
    - ❌ Competitor employee
    - ❌ Violates policies repeatedly

    **Response time:**
    - Review appeals within 48 hours
    - Respond to user with decision
    - If approved, unblock immediately

    <Warning>
    **Privacy consideration:** Don't reveal specific reason for block in initial message (could help spammers). Only explain in appeal response after verification.

## Monitoring Blacklist Effectiveness

Track the impact of your email blacklist on review quality and volume.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Key Metrics to Track" defaultOpen icon="chart-line">
    **Monitor these metrics monthly**

    **Block rate:**
    - Number of blocked attempts per month
    - Percentage of total review attempts
    - Trending up or down
    - **Target:** 5-15% block rate (higher = too broad, lower = too permissive)

    **Spam reduction:**
    - Spam reviews pre-blacklist vs post-blacklist
    - Percentage reduction in manual moderation
    - **Target:** 60-80% reduction in spam

    **False positive rate:**
    - Legitimate users incorrectly blocked
    - Appeals submitted and approved
    - **Target:** Under 5% false positive rate

    **Review volume impact:**
    - Total reviews pre-blacklist vs post-blacklist
    - Ensure not blocking too many legitimate users
    - **Target:** Less than 10% volume reduction

    **Time savings:**
    - Hours spent on manual moderation
    - Before vs after blacklist implementation
    - **Target:** 40-60% reduction in moderation time

    **Where to view:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Analytics → Reviews → Email Blacklist Impact**

    <Check>
    **Healthy blacklist:** 8-12% block rate, 70%+ spam reduction, under 5% false positives, less than 10% volume impact.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Blocked Attempts Log" icon="list">
    **Review blocked submission attempts**

    **Log details:**
    - Timestamp of attempt
    - Blocked email address
    - IP address
    - Product attempted to review
    - Blacklist rule that triggered block

    **How to use log:**

    **Identify false positives:**
    - Multiple blocks from same legitimate-looking email
    - Verified buyer blocked
    - Corporate domain with valid orders

    **Identify attack patterns:**
    - Multiple blocks from same IP
    - Sequential email addresses (spammer1@, spammer2@)
    - Same review content, different emails

    **Refine blacklist rules:**
    - Too many blocks from @gmail.com pattern = too broad
    - Zero blocks from competitor domain = add to list
    - Lots of disposable emails = import comprehensive list

    **Access log:**
    Settings → **Email Blacklist → Recent Block Attempts**

    **Log retention:** 90 days (Enterprise plan: 365 days)

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Review blocked attempts log weekly for first month after implementing blacklist. Identify false positives quickly and adjust rules.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="A/B Testing Blacklist Rules" icon="flask-vial">
    **Test blacklist effectiveness before full deployment**

    **Why A/B test:**
    - Validate impact before committing
    - Measure false positive rate
    - Optimize rules for best balance
    - Build confidence in configuration

    **How to A/B test:**

    **Option 1: Test mode (recommended)**
    1. Enable **Test Mode** in Email Blacklist settings
    2. Blacklist logs blocks but doesn't actually block
    3. Reviews go to "Pending Manual Review"
    4. Review blocked submissions manually
    5. Measure would-be false positives
    6. Adjust rules and repeat
    7. Deploy live when satisfied

    **Option 2: Gradual rollout**
    1. Start with only disposable emails
    2. Monitor for 7 days
    3. Add competitor domains
    4. Monitor for 7 days
    5. Add test account patterns
    6. Monitor and adjust

    **Option 3: Control group**
    1. Split products into two groups
    2. Apply blacklist to Group A only
    3. Compare spam rates Group A vs Group B
    4. Validate effectiveness
    5. Roll out to all products

    **Metrics to compare:**
    - Spam rate (A vs B)
    - Review volume (A vs B)
    - False positive rate
    - Time savings on moderation

    <Info>
    **Recommended approach:** Use Test Mode for 14 days before going live. Identifies 95% of false positive issues before impacting real users.

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines for effective email blacklist management.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Small, Expand Gradually" defaultOpen icon="seedling">
    **Don't block aggressively from day one**

    **Phase 1: Essential blocks only**
    - Internal company domain (@yourcompany.com)
    - Test account patterns (test@, demo@, admin@)
    - Known disposable email services (top 10)
    - **Result:** Minimal false positives, obvious spam blocked

    **Phase 2: Expand after monitoring**
    - Add competitor domains (after confirming attacks)
    - Import comprehensive disposable email list
    - Add repeat offenders
    - **Result:** Broader protection, still low false positives

    **Phase 3: Advanced patterns**
    - Wildcard patterns
    - Conditional blocking rules
    - Temporary blocks with expiration
    - **Result:** Maximum protection, sophisticated management

    **Timeline:**
    - Phase 1: Immediate (Day 1)
    - Phase 2: After 30 days of monitoring
    - Phase 3: After 90 days and 50+ blacklist entries

    <Check>
    **Recommended:** Start with just company domain and top 10 disposable email services. Expand only after detecting actual spam patterns.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Every Entry" icon="file-lines">
    **Add notes explaining why each email/domain is blocked**

    **Why documentation matters:**
    - Remember reason months later
    - Justify blocks if questioned
    - Train new team members
    - Audit compliance
    - Appeal reviews

    **Good notes examples:**
    ```
    @competitor.com - Main competitor, detected 15 fake negative reviews 2024-01-15
    spammer123@gmail.com - Repeat spammer, 8 fake 5-star reviews for unrelated products
    @tempmail.com - Disposable email service, 95% spam rate
    @yourcorp.com - Internal company domain, prevent employee reviews per FTC guidelines
    fake.reviewer@mail.com - Identified as review farm account, ties to 50+ fake reviews
    ```

    **Bad notes examples:**
    ```
    spam (not specific enough)
    blocked (doesn't explain why)
    ? (no information)
    (blank - worst option)
    ```

    **Note template:**
    ```
    [Email/Domain] - [Reason] [Evidence] [Date]
    ```

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Require notes for every blacklist entry. Set up form validation to enforce this. Future you will be grateful.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Blacklist Quarterly" icon="calendar-check">
    **Audit and clean up blacklist every 90 days**

    **Quarterly review checklist:**

    **1. Remove outdated entries**
    - Competitors who went out of business
    - Temporary blocks that should be permanent (or vice versa)
    - Test domains no longer used
    - Disposable email services shut down

  <Accordion title="Combine with Other Restrictions" icon="shield-check">
    **Use blacklist alongside other protection methods**

    **Multi-layered protection:**

    **Layer 1: Email blacklist**
    - Blocks known bad actors
    - Stops disposable emails
    - Prevents competitor attacks

    **Layer 2: IP rate limiting**
    - 5 reviews per day per IP
    - Catches bots and farms
    - Complements email blocks

    **Layer 3: Email verification**
    - Requires inbox access
    - Stops throwaway accounts that slip through
    - Reduces volume 15-30% but high quality

    **Layer 4: Verified buyer requirement**
    - Only purchased customers can review
    - Highest trust level
    - Reduces volume 30-50%

    **Layer 5: Content restrictions**
    - Character minimums (50 chars)
    - Personal info auto-removal
    - Profanity filtering

    **Recommended combination:**
    - Email blacklist (always)
    - IP rate limiting (always)
    - Either email verification OR verified buyer (not both)
    - Content restrictions (always)

    **Result:** 85-95% spam reduction, 15-30% volume reduction, 60% less moderation time

    <Check>
    **Optimal stack:** Email blacklist + IP rate limiting + 1 review per product + personal info removal. Blocks 90% of spam with only 10-15% volume impact.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can users bypass email blacklist by creating new addresses?" icon="user-secret">
    **Yes, but make it costly enough to deter them**

    **How users can bypass:**
    - Create new Gmail/Yahoo address (free, takes 2 minutes)
    - Use VPN or proxy to change IP
    - Use different disposable email service
    - Slightly modify email (john.doe vs johndoe)

    **How to make bypassing harder:**

    **Layer multiple protections:**
    - Email blacklist + IP rate limiting
    - Email blacklist + email verification requirement
    - Email blacklist + verified buyer requirement

    **Block patterns, not just addresses:**
    - Block @*.tempmail.* (all disposable variants)
    - Block known spam email patterns
    - Use conditional rules

    **Increase effort required:**
    - Require minimum 50 character reviews
    - Require email verification
    - Require purchase verification

    **Reality check:**
    - Casual spammers won't bother (90% of spam)
    - Determined attackers will bypass (10% of spam)
    - Focus on making it not worth their time
    - Catch sophisticated attacks with manual moderation

    <Info>
    **Goal:** Raise barrier high enough that 90-95% of spammers give up. Perfect protection is impossible, but good protection is very achievable.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I block all free email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)?" icon="ban">
    **No - blocks too many legitimate customers**

    **Why not to block free emails:**
    - 60-80% of customers use Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook
    - Massive false positive rate
    - Customers will be frustrated and confused
    - Reduces review volume by 60-80%
    - Harms customer trust

    **Exceptions (rare):**
    - Pure B2B store (only corporate emails expected)
    - High-security industry (government, finance)
    - Verified buyer requirement already in place

    **Better alternatives:**

    **Instead of blocking Gmail:**
    - Block disposable email domains only
    - Require email verification for free emails
    - Use verified buyer requirement
    - IP rate limiting (5/day)

    **Targeted blocking:**
    - Block specific spammer addresses on Gmail
    - Block temporary Google accounts (detectable patterns)
    - Use conditional rules (free email + unverified purchase = manual review)

    <Warning>
    **Never block:** @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, @icloud.com, @aol.com. These are legitimate free providers used by majority of customers.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle false positives?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Provide clear appeal process and respond quickly**

    **When false positives occur:**
    1. Customer attempts to submit review
    2. Gets "Email not eligible" message with appeal link
    3. Submits appeal via form or email
    4. You review within 48 hours
    5. Unblock if legitimate
    6. Apologize and invite them to resubmit

    **Common false positive scenarios:**

    **Corporate domain blocked:**
    - Blocked @largecorp.com thinking it was competitor
    - But customer is legitimate B2B buyer from that company
    - **Solution:** Unblock specific email, keep domain blocked
    - **Better:** Use conditional rule (allow if verified purchase)

    **Wildcard too broad:**
    - Blocked test*@* to block test accounts
    - But customer's name is "Tester" with email tester@gmail.com
    - **Solution:** Refine wildcard to test@yourstore.com only

    **Shared email:**
    - Blocked john@family.com for spam
    - But John's wife Sarah also uses john@family.com legitimately
    - **Solution:** Temporary 30-day block, allow appeal

    **Prevention:**
    - Test blacklist rules before deploying
    - Use conditional blocking
    - Provide clear appeal process
    - Monitor false positive rate weekly

    **Target false positive rate:** Under 5% of blocks

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Email every blocked legitimate user personally, apologize, and offer 10% discount as goodwill. Turns negative into positive brand experience.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I block emails from specific countries?" icon="globe">
    **Yes, via domain TLD blocking, but not recommended**

    **How to block by country:**
    - Block top-level domains (TLDs): @*.ru, @*.cn, @*.br
    - Example: Blocks .ru (Russia), .cn (China), .br (Brazil)

    **Risks and concerns:**

    **Legal risks:**
    - May violate anti-discrimination laws
    - Could be considered xenophobic
    - Bad publicity if discovered

    **Business risks:**
    - Blocks legitimate international customers
    - Harms global expansion
    - Reduces review volume significantly

    **Practical limitations:**
    - Most spammers use .com or disposable emails anyway
    - TLD blocking catches very little actual spam
    - High false positive rate

    **Better alternatives:**

    **Instead of blocking countries:**
    - Block disposable email services (works globally)
    - Use IP rate limiting (catches VPNs and farms)
    - Require verified purchases (works regardless of country)
    - Use spam detection algorithms (language-independent)

    **When country blocking might make sense:**
    - You don't ship to that country (no legitimate customers there)
    - 95%+ of traffic from that TLD is spam
    - Combined with other factors (unverified + country + suspicious)

    <Warning>
    **Recommendation:** Avoid TLD/country blocking unless you have very specific, documented spam problem from that TLD and zero legitimate customers there. Risk outweighs benefit 95% of the time.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often should I update my blacklist?" icon="rotate">
    **Weekly additions, quarterly audits**

    **Weekly (5-10 minutes):**
    - Add new disposable email domains detected
    - Add repeat spammer addresses
    - Add new competitor domains if relevant
    - Review blocked attempts log for patterns

    **Monthly (15-30 minutes):**
    - Review appeal submissions
    - Unblock temporary blocks that expired
    - Check false positive rate
    - Update notes on existing entries

    **Quarterly (30-60 minutes):**
    - Full blacklist audit
    - Remove outdated entries
    - Update disposable email list (import new version)
    - Review effectiveness metrics
    - Adjust strategies based on data

    **Annual (1-2 hours):**
    - Complete blacklist refresh
    - Export and backup
    - Document policy changes
    - Train team on updates

    **Automation opportunities:**
    - Auto-import disposable email updates monthly
    - Auto-expire temporary blocks
    - Auto-flag entries with zero blocks for review

    <Check>
    **Recommended schedule:** 10 minutes weekly for additions + 30 minutes quarterly for audit = 3 hours per year. Minimal time investment for major spam reduction.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to existing reviews from blacklisted emails?" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Nothing - blacklist only affects future submissions**

    **When you add email to blacklist:**
    - ✅ Blocks all future review attempts from that email
    - ❌ Does NOT delete existing reviews from that email
    - ❌ Does NOT hide existing reviews
    - ❌ Does NOT notify the user they're blocked

    **If you want to remove existing reviews:**
    1. Add email to blacklist (prevents new ones)
    2. Manually find reviews by that email
    3. Delete reviews individually
    4. Or bulk delete via **Manage Reviews → Filter by email → Delete**

    **Retroactive removal options:**

    **Option 1: Manual deletion**
    - Search reviews by email address
    - Review each one
    - Delete spam, keep legitimate ones

    **Option 2: Bulk deletion**
    - Export reviews by blacklisted email
    - Review in spreadsheet
    - Bulk delete via API or CSV import

    **Option 3: Keep existing reviews**
    - Don't delete past reviews
    - Just block future ones
    - Less work, preserves legitimate reviews
    - Recommended approach

    <Info>
    **Recommended:** Add email to blacklist to prevent future spam, but don't retroactively delete unless reviews are clearly spam/harmful. Past reviews may be legitimate even if future ones won't be.
