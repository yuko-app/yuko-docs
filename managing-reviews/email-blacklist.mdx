</Info>

## Understanding Email Blacklisting

Email blacklisting prevents specific addresses or entire domains from submitting reviews.

    **Block specific email addresses**

    - Single addresses ([john.doe@spam.com](mailto:john.doe@spam.com))
    - Exact match required
    - Blocks that specific user only
    - Good for repeat offenders

    **Example:**

    - [competitor@rivalstore.com](mailto:competitor@rivalstore.com)
    - [spammer123@gmail.com](mailto:spammer123@gmail.com)
    - [abusiveuser@email.com](mailto:abusiveuser@email.com)

    **Use for:** Targeting specific problem users
  </Card>
  <Card title="Domain Blocking" icon="globe">
    **Block entire email domains**

    - All addresses from domain (@spam.com)
    - Wildcard matching
    - Blocks all users from that domain
    - Good for competitor stores, disposable email services

    **Example:**

    - @competitorstore.com
    - @tempmail.com
    - @yourcompany.com (internal)

    **Use for:** Broad protection against spam sources

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can users bypass email blacklist by creating new addresses?" icon="user-secret">
    **Yes, but make it costly enough to deter them**

    **How users can bypass:**

    - Create new Gmail/Yahoo address (free, takes 2 minutes)
    - Use VPN or proxy to change IP
    - Use different disposable email service
    - Slightly modify email (john.doe vs johndoe)

    **How to make bypassing harder:**

    **Layer multiple protections:**

    - Email blacklist + IP rate limiting
    - Email blacklist + email verification requirement
    - Email blacklist + verified buyer requirement

    **Block patterns, not just addresses:**

    - Block @_.tempmail._ (all disposable variants)
    - Block known spam email patterns
    - Use conditional rules

    **Increase effort required:**

    - Require minimum 50 character reviews
    - Require email verification
    - Require purchase verification

    **Reality check:**

    - Casual spammers won't bother (90% of spam)
    - Determined attackers will bypass (10% of spam)
    - Focus on making it not worth their time
    - Catch sophisticated attacks with manual moderation

    <Info>
      **Goal:** Raise barrier high enough that 90-95% of spammers give up. Perfect protection is impossible, but good protection is very achievable.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I block all free email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)?" icon="ban">
    **No - blocks too many legitimate customers**

    **Why not to block free emails:**

    - 60-80% of customers use Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook
    - Massive false positive rate
    - Customers will be frustrated and confused
    - Reduces review volume by 60-80%
    - Harms customer trust

    **Exceptions (rare):**

    - Pure B2B store (only corporate emails expected)
    - High-security industry (government, finance)
    - Verified buyer requirement already in place

    **Better alternatives:**

    **Instead of blocking Gmail:**

    - Block disposable email domains only
    - Require email verification for free emails
    - Use verified buyer requirement
    - IP rate limiting (5/day)

    **Targeted blocking:**

    - Block specific spammer addresses on Gmail
    - Block temporary Google accounts (detectable patterns)
    - Use conditional rules (free email + unverified purchase = manual review)

    <Warning>
      **Never block:** @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, @icloud.com, @aol.com. These are legitimate free providers used by majority of customers.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I handle false positives?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Provide clear appeal process and respond quickly**

    **When false positives occur:**

    1. Customer attempts to submit review
    2. Gets "Email not eligible" message with appeal link
    3. Submits appeal via form or email
    4. You review within 48 hours
    5. Unblock if legitimate
    6. Apologize and invite them to resubmit

    **Common false positive scenarios:**

    **Corporate domain blocked:**

    - Blocked @largecorp.com thinking it was competitor
    - But customer is legitimate B2B buyer from that company
    - **Solution:** Unblock specific email, keep domain blocked
    - **Better:** Use conditional rule (allow if verified purchase)

    **Wildcard too broad:**

    - Blocked test\*@\* to block test accounts
    - But customer's name is "Tester" with email [tester@gmail.com](mailto:tester@gmail.com)
    - **Solution:** Refine wildcard to [test@yourstore.com](mailto:test@yourstore.com) only

    **Shared email:**

    - Blocked [john@family.com](mailto:john@family.com) for spam
    - But John's wife Sarah also uses [john@family.com](mailto:john@family.com) legitimately
    - **Solution:** Temporary 30-day block, allow appeal

    **Prevention:**

    - Test blacklist rules before deploying
    - Use conditional blocking
    - Provide clear appeal process
    - Monitor false positive rate weekly

    **Target false positive rate:** Under 5% of blocks

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Email every blocked legitimate user personally, apologize, and offer 10% discount as goodwill. Turns negative into positive brand experience.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I block emails from specific countries?" icon="globe">
    **Yes, via domain TLD blocking, but not recommended**

    **How to block by country:**

    - Block top-level domains (TLDs): @_.ru, @_.cn, @\*.br
    - Example: Blocks .ru (Russia), .cn (China), .br (Brazil)

    **Risks and concerns:**

    **Legal risks:**

    - May violate anti-discrimination laws
    - Could be considered xenophobic
    - Bad publicity if discovered

    **Business risks:**

    - Blocks legitimate international customers
    - Harms global expansion
    - Reduces review volume significantly

    **Practical limitations:**

    - Most spammers use .com or disposable emails anyway
    - TLD blocking catches very little actual spam
    - High false positive rate

    **Better alternatives:**

    **Instead of blocking countries:**

    - Block disposable email services (works globally)
    - Use IP rate limiting (catches VPNs and farms)
    - Require verified purchases (works regardless of country)
    - Use spam detection algorithms (language-independent)

    **When country blocking might make sense:**

    - You don't ship to that country (no legitimate customers there)
    - 95%+ of traffic from that TLD is spam
    - Combined with other factors (unverified + country + suspicious)

    <Warning>
      **Recommendation:** Avoid TLD/country blocking unless you have very specific, documented spam problem from that TLD and zero legitimate customers there. Risk outweighs benefit 95% of the time.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often should I update my blacklist?" icon="rotate">
    **Weekly additions, quarterly audits**

    **Weekly (5-10 minutes):**

    - Add new disposable email domains detected
    - Add repeat spammer addresses
    - Add new competitor domains if relevant
    - Review blocked attempts log for patterns

    **Monthly (15-30 minutes):**

    - Review appeal submissions
    - Unblock temporary blocks that expired
    - Check false positive rate
    - Update notes on existing entries

    **Quarterly (30-60 minutes):**

    - Full blacklist audit
    - Remove outdated entries
    - Update disposable email list (import new version)
    - Review effectiveness metrics
    - Adjust strategies based on data

    **Annual (1-2 hours):**

    - Complete blacklist refresh
    - Export and backup
    - Document policy changes
    - Train team on updates

    **Automation opportunities:**

    - Auto-import disposable email updates monthly
    - Auto-expire temporary blocks
    - Auto-flag entries with zero blocks for review

    <Check>
      **Recommended schedule:** 10 minutes weekly for additions + 30 minutes quarterly for audit = 3 hours per year. Minimal time investment for major spam reduction.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to existing reviews from blacklisted emails?" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Nothing - blacklist only affects future submissions**

    **When you add email to blacklist:**

    - ✅ Blocks all future review attempts from that email
    - ❌ Does NOT delete existing reviews from that email
    - ❌ Does NOT hide existing reviews
    - ❌ Does NOT notify the user they're blocked

    **If you want to remove existing reviews:**

    1. Add email to blacklist (prevents new ones)
    2. Manually find reviews by that email
    3. Delete reviews individually
    4. Or bulk delete via **Manage Reviews → Filter by email → Delete**

    **Retroactive removal options:**

    **Option 1: Manual deletion**

    - Search reviews by email address
    - Review each one
    - Delete spam, keep legitimate ones

    **Option 2: Bulk deletion**

    - Export reviews by blacklisted email
    - Review in spreadsheet
    - Bulk delete via API or CSV import

    **Option 3: Keep existing reviews**

    - Don't delete past reviews
    - Just block future ones
    - Less work, preserves legitimate reviews
    - Recommended approach

    <Info>
      **Recommended:** Add email to blacklist to prevent future spam, but don't retroactively delete unless reviews are clearly spam/harmful. Past reviews may be legitimate even if future ones won't be.

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** Most effective blacklist strategy is blocking disposable emails (high spam rate, zero false positives) + individual repeat offenders + company domain. Skip broad wildcards and country blocks - they cause more problems than they solve.
