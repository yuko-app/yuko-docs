## Reply Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to maximize the impact of your review responses.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Response Timing Guidelines" defaultOpen icon="clock">
    **Respond quickly to show you care**

    **Recommended response times:**
    - **5-star reviews:** Within 48 hours (shows appreciation)
    - **4-star reviews:** Within 36 hours (address concerns promptly)
    - **3-star reviews:** Within 24 hours (opportunity to improve)
    - **1-2 star reviews:** Within 12 hours (urgent recovery needed)

    **Why timing matters:**
    - 67% of customers change their rating after quick, helpful response
    - Fast replies to negative reviews reduce escalation risk by 80%
    - Prompt responses appear in review feeds (boost visibility)

    **Setup reply alerts:**
    Enable notifications in **Settings → Notifications** to never miss a review.

    <Check>
    **Pro tip:** Set up auto-replies for 5-star reviews during non-business hours, then personalize during business hours. Customers appreciate immediate acknowledgment.
    </Check>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tone and Language Guidelines" icon="message-smile">
    **Sound genuine, not robotic**

    **Do's:**
    - ✅ Use customer's name when available
    - ✅ Reference specific details from their review
    - ✅ Match your brand voice (formal, casual, playful, etc.)
    - ✅ Show genuine emotion (excitement for positive, concern for negative)
    - ✅ Keep replies conversational and natural

    **Don'ts:**
    - ❌ Copy-paste same reply to every review
    - ❌ Use overly formal corporate language
    - ❌ Make promises you can't keep
    - ❌ Get defensive or argumentative
    - ❌ Use emojis excessively (1-2 max)

    **Example comparison:**

    **Robotic (bad):**
    > Thank you for your review. We appreciate your feedback and hope to serve you again soon.

    **Genuine (good):**
    > Hi Sarah! We're so glad you're loving the organic cotton tee. Your comment about the perfect fit made our day! Can't wait to welcome you back. 💚
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Addressing Negative Feedback Publicly" icon="shield-check">
    **Turn complaints into demonstrations of great service**

    **The negative review response formula:**

    1. **Apologize sincerely** (no excuses)
       > "We're truly sorry your experience didn't meet expectations."

    2. **Acknowledge specific issue** (show you read carefully)
       > "Your point about the delayed shipping is completely valid."

    3. **Take ownership** (even if not 100% your fault)
       > "We should have communicated the delay better."

    4. **Offer solution** (be specific)
       > "We'd like to offer a full refund plus 20% off your next order."

    5. **Move offline** (for details)
       > "Please email support@yourstore.com with order #12345 - we'll prioritize this."

    6. **Follow up publicly** (once resolved)
       > "Update: We've resolved this and sent Sarah a replacement. Thank you for your patience!"

    **Why this works:**
    - Future customers see you handle issues professionally
    - 70% of shoppers trust brands MORE after seeing well-handled negative reviews
    - Shows transparency and commitment to service

    <Warning>
    **Never do this:**
    - ❌ Blame the customer ("You should have read the sizing guide")
    - ❌ Blame shipping companies ("It's not our fault FedEx delayed it")
    - ❌ Argue about details publicly
    - ❌ Ignore negative reviews
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Encouraging Review Updates" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Get customers to revise negative reviews after resolution**

    **After successfully resolving an issue:**

    1. **Follow up with customer directly** (email or phone)
       - Confirm they're satisfied with resolution
       - Thank them for their patience
       - Ask if there's anything else needed

    2. **Politely request review update** (don't demand)
       > "We're so glad we could make this right! If you feel we've earned it, we'd be grateful if you could update your review to reflect your resolved experience."

    3. **Make it easy** (provide direct link)
       - Send direct link to their review for editing
       - Include simple instructions
       - No pressure - optional only

    4. **Update your public reply** (regardless of review update)
       - Add a follow-up note on your original reply
       - Mention that issue was resolved
       - Thank customer for giving you chance to improve

    **Success rate:**
    - 40-60% of customers update negative reviews after excellent recovery
    - Updated reviews often become your best testimonials
    - Shows future customers you follow through

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** If customer updates to 4-5 stars, reply again thanking them for the update. Double engagement shows exceptional commitment.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reply Rate and Consistency" icon="chart-line">
    **Maintain high response rates for maximum impact**

    **Target reply rates:**
    - **5-star reviews:** 60-80% reply rate (minimum)
    - **4-star reviews:** 90-100% reply rate (important feedback)
    - **1-3 star reviews:** 100% reply rate (non-negotiable)
    - **All reviews combined:** Aim for 75%+ overall reply rate

    **Why consistency matters:**
    - Customers notice when you reply to some but not others
    - Selective replying looks suspicious or biased
    - High reply rate signals active, engaged brand

    **Track your reply rate:**
    - View in **Analytics → Review Management**
    - See breakdown by rating, product, time period
    - Compare to industry benchmarks
    - Set team goals and track progress

    **Improving reply rate:**
    - Set daily reply time blocks (15-30 minutes)
    - Use templates for efficiency (customize before sending)
    - Enable notifications so reviews don't pile up
    - Assign team members if high volume

    <Check>
    **Benchmark:** Top-performing stores maintain 85%+ reply rates and see 2-3x higher review engagement as a result.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can customers reply to my replies?" icon="comment">
    **No, reviews are not threaded conversations**

    Yuko reviews work like most review platforms:
    - Customer posts review → You reply once → Conversation ends
    - Customers cannot reply to your replies
    - For further discussion, move to email or phone

    **If customer has follow-up questions:**
    1. They can edit their original review (adds updated content)
    2. You can edit your reply to address new points
    3. Best practice: Invite them to contact you directly for detailed help

    **Example:**
    > "Thanks for your follow-up, John! For detailed sizing help, please email sizing@store.com or call us at (555) 123-4567 - we're here to help!"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I reply to ALL reviews or just negative ones?" icon="list-check">
    **Reply to as many as possible - all ratings matter**

    **Priority order:**
    1. **All 1-3 star reviews:** 100% reply rate (damage control)
    2. **4-star reviews with concerns:** 90-100% reply rate (improvement opportunity)
    3. **5-star detailed reviews:** 60-80% reply rate (build relationships)
    4. **5-star brief reviews:** 40-60% reply rate (show appreciation)

    **Why reply to positive reviews:**
    - Builds customer loyalty and repeat purchases
    - Encourages more customers to leave reviews
    - Shows you read and value all feedback
    - Makes review section feel more alive and engaging

    **If overwhelmed:**
    - Use templates for common 5-star replies (personalize slightly)
    - Prioritize negative and detailed reviews first
    - Aim for at least 75% overall reply rate

    <Info>
    **Data shows:** Stores that reply to 80%+ of ALL reviews (not just negative ones) see 45% higher customer retention rates than those who only reply to negative reviews.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long should my replies be?" icon="text-size">
    **Length depends on the review rating and complexity**

    **Recommended reply lengths:**

    **5-star simple reviews:**
    - 2-3 sentences (30-60 words)
    - Example: "Thank you so much for the 5 stars, Maria! We're thrilled you love the dress. Can't wait to see you back!"

    **5-star detailed reviews:**
    - 3-5 sentences (60-100 words)
    - Reference specific details they mentioned
    - Show you read carefully

    **4-star reviews with suggestions:**
    - 4-6 sentences (80-120 words)
    - Address both positives and concerns
    - Explain improvements or invite discussion

    **1-3 star negative reviews:**
    - 5-8 sentences (100-150 words)
    - Sincere apology
    - Specific solution
    - Contact information for follow-up
    - Professional but warm tone

    <Tip>
    **Pro tip:** Match their energy - if they wrote 2 lines, don't write a novel. If they wrote a detailed paragraph, give a thoughtful response.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete or edit customer reviews?" icon="user-pen">
    **You can reply, but NOT edit customer review content**

    **What you CAN do:**
    - Reply to any review (your reply appears below their review)
    - Edit or delete YOUR replies (not customer content)
    - Hide reviews from display (marks as spam or inappropriate)
    - Request review removal if violates policies

    **What you CANNOT do:**
    - ❌ Edit customer's review text
    - ❌ Change customer's star rating
    - ❌ Delete reviews just because they're negative

    **If a review violates policies:**
    1. Mark review as spam (if fake or promotional)
    2. Report review if contains profanity, threats, or personal attacks
    3. Use Yuko's profanity filter to censor inappropriate language automatically

    **Review removal criteria:**
    - Contains hate speech or threats
    - Includes personal information (phone, email, address)
    - Is clearly fake or paid (spam)
    - Violates your store's review guidelines

    **Navigation:**
    Yuko Dashboard → **Manage Reviews** → Click review → **Report or Hide**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I offer refunds or discounts publicly in replies?" icon="tag">
    **Be specific but move financial details offline**

    **Public reply approach:**

    **DO say:**
    - "We'd like to offer you a full refund"
    - "Please contact us - we'll send a replacement at no charge"
    - "We're applying a credit to your account"
    - "Mention this review for 20% off your next order"

    **DON'T say:**
    - Specific refund amounts or order totals
    - Customer's payment or shipping details
    - Account numbers or personal information
    - Discount codes others could exploit

    **Best practice formula:**
    > "We'd like to make this right with [general solution]. Please email support@store.com with order reference #12345 and we'll handle this immediately."

    **Why this works:**
    - Shows future customers you resolve issues fairly
    - Protects customer privacy
    - Prevents discount code abuse
    - Allows personalized resolution in private

    <Warning>
    **Privacy alert:** Never include customer's full order number, email address, phone number, or shipping address in public replies.
    </Warning>

       - Ask for order number to verify
       - Example: "We'd love to help resolve this! Could you email us your order number at support@store.com so we can look into this?"

    3. **Enable verified purchase badges**
       - Reduces impact of unverified reviews
       - Shows customers which reviews are from real purchasers
       - Settings → **Reviews → Verified Badges**

    4. **Setup automatic filters**
       - Block reviews from disposable email domains

    **Navigation:**
