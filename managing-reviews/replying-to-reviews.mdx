## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can customers reply to my replies?" icon="comment">
    **No, reviews are not threaded conversations**

    Yuko reviews work like most review platforms:

    - Customer posts review → You reply once → Conversation ends
    - Customers cannot reply to your replies
    - For further discussion, move to email or phone

    **If customer has follow-up questions:**

    1. They can edit their original review (adds updated content)
    2. You can edit your reply to address new points
    3. Best practice: Invite them to contact you directly for detailed help

    **Example:**

    > "Thanks for your follow-up, John! For detailed sizing help, please email [sizing@store.com](mailto:sizing@store.com) or call us at (555) 123-4567 - we're here to help!"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I reply to ALL reviews or just negative ones?" icon="list-check">
    **Reply to as many as possible - all ratings matter**

    **Priority order:**

    1. **All 1-3 star reviews:** 100% reply rate (damage control)
    2. **4-star reviews with concerns:** 90-100% reply rate (improvement opportunity)
    3. **5-star detailed reviews:** 60-80% reply rate (build relationships)
    4. **5-star brief reviews:** 40-60% reply rate (show appreciation)

    **Why reply to positive reviews:**

    - Builds customer loyalty and repeat purchases
    - Encourages more customers to leave reviews
    - Shows you read and value all feedback
    - Makes review section feel more alive and engaging

    **If overwhelmed:**

    - Use templates for common 5-star replies (personalize slightly)
    - Prioritize negative and detailed reviews first
    - Aim for at least 75% overall reply rate

    <Info>
      **Data shows:** Stores that reply to 80%+ of ALL reviews (not just negative ones) see 45% higher customer retention rates than those who only reply to negative reviews.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long should my replies be?" icon="text-size">
    **Length depends on the review rating and complexity**

    **Recommended reply lengths:**

    **5-star simple reviews:**

    - 2-3 sentences (30-60 words)
    - Example: "Thank you so much for the 5 stars, Maria! We're thrilled you love the dress. Can't wait to see you back!"

    **5-star detailed reviews:**

    - 3-5 sentences (60-100 words)
    - Reference specific details they mentioned
    - Show you read carefully

    **4-star reviews with suggestions:**

    - 4-6 sentences (80-120 words)
    - Address both positives and concerns
    - Explain improvements or invite discussion

    **1-3 star negative reviews:**

    - 5-8 sentences (100-150 words)
    - Sincere apology
    - Specific solution
    - Contact information for follow-up
    - Professional but warm tone

    <Tip>
      **Pro tip:** Match their energy - if they wrote 2 lines, don't write a novel. If they wrote a detailed paragraph, give a thoughtful response.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I delete or edit customer reviews?" icon="user-pen">
    **You can reply, but NOT edit customer review content**

    **What you CAN do:**

    - Reply to any review (your reply appears below their review)
    - Edit or delete YOUR replies (not customer content)
    - Hide reviews from display (marks as spam or inappropriate)
    - Request review removal if violates policies

    **What you CANNOT do:**

    - ❌ Edit customer's review text
    - ❌ Change customer's star rating
    - ❌ Delete reviews just because they're negative

    **If a review violates policies:**

    1. Mark review as spam (if fake or promotional)
    2. Report review if contains profanity, threats, or personal attacks
    3. Use Yuko's profanity filter to censor inappropriate language automatically

    **Review removal criteria:**

    - Contains hate speech or threats
    - Includes personal information (phone, email, address)
    - Is clearly fake or paid (spam)
    - Violates your store's review guidelines

    **Navigation:** Yuko Dashboard → **Manage Reviews** → Click review → **Report or Hide**
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Should I offer refunds or discounts publicly in replies?" icon="tag">
    **Be specific but move financial details offline**

    **Public reply approach:**

    **DO say:**

    - "We'd like to offer you a full refund"
    - "Please contact us - we'll send a replacement at no charge"
    - "We're applying a credit to your account"
    - "Mention this review for 20% off your next order"

    **DON'T say:**

    - Specific refund amounts or order totals
    - Customer's payment or shipping details
    - Account numbers or personal information
    - Discount codes others could exploit

    **Best practice formula:**

    > "We'd like to make this right with [general solution]. Please email [support@store.com](mailto:support@store.com) with order reference #12345 and we'll handle this immediately."

    **Why this works:**

    - Shows future customers you resolve issues fairly
    - Protects customer privacy
    - Prevents discount code abuse
    - Allows personalized resolution in private

    <Warning>
      **Privacy alert:** Never include customer's full order number, email address, phone number, or shipping address in public replies.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

       - Example: "We'd love to help resolve this! Could you email us your order number at [support@store.com](mailto:support@store.com) so we can look into this?"
    3. **Enable verified purchase badges**
       - Reduces impact of unverified reviews
       - Shows customers which reviews are from real purchasers
       - Settings → **Reviews → Verified Badges**
    4. **Setup automatic filters**
       - Block reviews from disposable email domains
       - Flag unverified purchases for manual review
       - Require minimum order value for auto-publishing

    **Navigation:** Yuko Dashboard → **Manage Reviews** → Select review → **Mark as Spam**
