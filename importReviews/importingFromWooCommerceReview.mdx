### **Navigation**

Yuko Dashboard → **Reviews → Import → WooCommerce**

### **Overview**

If your store has existing WooCommerce product reviews, you can import them directly into Yuko with one click.\
All your WooCommerce reviews will sync automatically — including author name, rating, date, and comment.

## **Steps to Import**

1. Go to your **Yuko Dashboard → Reviews → Import**.
2. Click **Import from WooCommerce**.
3. Yuko will automatically fetch your store’s reviews through the connected integration.
4. Wait for the import to complete (you’ll see a progress indicator).

Once complete, your reviews will appear under **Reviews → Manage Reviews**.
