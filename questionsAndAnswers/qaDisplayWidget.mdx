   - **Preferences** – Control how questions and answers are shown to customers (sorting, visibility, and structure).
   - **Advanced CSS** – Add custom styling for a fully branded appearance.
3. Use the **desktop / mobile preview toggle** at the top to see how it looks across devices.
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes instantly.
