Review Syndication lets you **share reviews across multiple stores** connected through a syndication group.

Reviews collected on one store can automatically appear on matching products in other connected stores, helping you build social proof faster across your storefront network.

**Navigation : Yuko Dashboard → Settings → Reviews → Syndication**

## How Review Syndication Works

When stores are connected through a syndication group:

- Reviews collected on one store are shared with other connected stores
- Reviews appear on matching products across all stores in the group
- Syndicated reviews stay in sync automatically

<Note>
  **Important:** Products must have **identical SKUs** across all connected stores for reviews to sync correctly.

## Group Token

The group token is used to connect additional stores to the syndication group.

From the group details page, you can:

- Copy the group token
- Regenerate the token if needed
- Share the token securely with other store owners

> 🔐 Anyone with the token can request to join the group.

## Join an Existing Syndication Group

If another store has shared a group token with you, you can join their syndication group.

### To Join a Group

1. Go to **Settings → Reviews → Syndication**
2. Under **Join an Existing Group**, paste the **Group Token**
3. Click **Join Group**

## Manage Syndication Groups

For each syndication group, you can view and manage:

- Connected stores
- Store join dates
- Group status (Active / Inactive)
- Group token access

### Activate or Deactivate a Group

- **Active:** Reviews are shared across connected stores
- **Inactive:** Review syncing is paused without removing stores

A visual status indicator shows whether a group is currently active.

---

## Delete a Syndication Group

You can delete a syndication group at any time.

When a group is deleted:

- All stores are disconnected
- Review syncing stops immediately
- Existing reviews remain intact on each store

> ⚠️ Deleting a group cannot be undone.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure SKUs match exactly across all connected stores
- Use clear group names for easy identification
- Share group tokens securely
- Test syndication with a small group before scaling

Review Syndication is ideal if you:

- Operate multiple storefronts or regions
- Sell the same products across different stores
- Want to build social proof faster
