Customize how your reviews look, behave, and are managed. Review Settings allow you to control how reviews are collected, displayed, moderated, and shared across your store.

From branding your review widgets to restricting who can leave reviews, these settings give you full control over the review experience for both customers and admins.

## Available Review Settings

Under **Settings → Reviews**, you’ll find the following sections:

- **Branding**
- **General**
- **Product Blacklist**
- **Product Groups**
- **Syndication**

Each section focuses on a specific part of your review workflow.

---

## Branding

The **Branding** section lets you customize the visual appearance of your reviews and review forms to match your store’s design.

Here, you can configure:

- Color palette and customized colors
- Review fonts and typography
- Star rating icons and styles
- Buttons, inputs, and dialog styling
- Overall look and feel of review widgets

Branding settings ensure your review experience feels consistent with your storefront and checkout design.

---

## General

The **General** section contains the core review behavior and control settings.

This section includes:

- Review publishing and moderation rules
- Review restrictions and limits
- Review display controls
- Google and SEO-related review settings
- Admin notifications and alerts

These settings define **who can leave reviews**, **how reviews are published**, and **how they appear across your store and search results**.

---

## Product Blacklist

The **Product Blacklist** allows you to exclude specific products from review collection.

Use this section to:

- Prevent review request emails for selected products
- Exclude products from manual review collection
- Manage exclusions using product IDs

This is useful for products like services, subscriptions, test items, or internal products where reviews are not needed.

---

## Product Groups

**Product Groups** let you manage review behavior at scale by grouping products together.

From this section, you can:

- Enable or disable product groups
- Create static groups by manually selecting products
- Create dynamic groups based on product attributes such as:
  - Tags
  - Categories
  - Product name conditions

Product groups help you apply review rules efficiently across large catalogs.

---

## Syndication

The **Syndication** section allows you to share reviews across multiple connected stores.

With review syndication:

- Reviews collected on one store can appear on matching products in other connected stores
- You can create a new syndication group or join an existing one
- Reviews stay synchronized across all stores in the same group

This is ideal for merchants managing multiple storefronts or regional stores with overlapping product catalogs.
