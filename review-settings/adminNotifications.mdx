| **Notification Types**               | Choose which updates to receive: **Reviews** and/or **Q&A**.                |

### **How It Works**

Once enabled, the listed admins will receive an email whenever:

- A **new review** is submitted.
- A **new Q&A** entry is posted by a customer.

This ensures your team stays informed about all review-related activities in real time.
